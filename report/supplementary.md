# Impact of assuming no further hydroelectricity capacity expansion

In this study, I do not consider any expansion of hydroelectricity capacities from today's levels. This is a slightly conservative assumption, as Gernaat et al. [@Gernaat:2017] find that Europe's hydroelectricity potential is 50% above today's generation when considering technical, economic, and ecological constraints. However, the authors find that 85% of this expansion stems from run-of-river installations which generate electricity but do not contribute to balancing generation from solar and wind power. Thus, I consider the impact of further expansion of run-of-river capacities on my results to be small, as it would impact all cases in a similar way.

Any expansion of dispatchable hydroelectricity capacity likely impacts my results, because such capacity can provide balancing and reduce the need for other -- likely more costly -- forms of balancing. I expect higher shares of dispatchable hydroelectricity capacity to reduce total system cost especially of the solar-centred cases. However, according to Gernaat et al. [@Gernaat:2017] the potential to expand this kind of capacity is low (< 1% of current electricity demand of the European Union) and thus I consider the impact of further capacity expansion of dispatchable capacity on the results of this study to be low.

Land requirements are given relative to total national land.](report/land-use/map-land-requirements.png){#fig:map-land .class secno=1}
