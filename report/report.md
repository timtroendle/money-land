# Introduction

Europe has the potential to generate all its electricity from renewable sources [@Jacobson:2017; @Ruiz:2019; @Trondle:2019]. The potential provides means to decarbonise the European electricity system, which is a necessary step to reach the European Commission's goal of becoming a climate-neutral economy by 2050 [@EuropeanCommission:2018]. Compared to the predominant forms of electricity supply based on fossil and nuclear fuels, land requirements of renewable electricity are high [@MacKay:2008; @Smil:2015; @Stevens:2017; @vanZalk:2018], however. A transition to renewable electricity will therefore likely increase the total land requirements of electricity supply and it may even do so by orders of magnitude.

While renewable electricity is an indispensable option to mitigate global climate change, its high land requirements have the potential to cause conflicts locally where it is built. This is for two reasons. First, it may compete with other uses of land. Of the main two current technologies of renewable electricity, photovoltaics and wind turbines, only the latter allows for limited dual use of land: for technical reasons, spacing between turbines is large and, as a result, can be used for agriculture [@Smil:2015]. Second, renewable generation infrastructure has the potential to economically devaluate land on which it is built, and also neighbouring land. There is conflicting evidence whether wind power in sight of properties can impact property values, and while the majority of studies does not find statistically significant impacts, some others find losses in property values of up to 15% [@Brinkley:2019]. Wind [@Molnarova:2012] and solar power [@Sanchez-Pantoja:2018] are sometimes perceived as negatively impacting the landscape, depending on place attachment and the aesthetics of the previously undisturbed landscape [@Devine-Wright:2010; @Molnarova:2012; @deVries:2012], and location and density of structures [@Molnarova:2012].

While generally the acceptance of the energy transition is high and the majority of the population does not feel disturbed by wind and solar installations [@Knebel:2016; @Setton:2019], local opposition has hindered and postponed local renewable electricity projects in the past [@Stokes:2016; @Spath:2018]. Opposition may continue in the future, considering the significant expansion of impacted land area moving towards fully decarbonised electricity supply. This led some authors to the conclusion that fully renewable electricity -- while being theoretically possible -- will not be feasible in Europe [@MacKay:2008; @Smil:2015].

Strategies to mitigate negative impacts associated to the land requirements of renewable electricity include location and placement of generation infrastructure [@Molnarova:2012] and technology choice to reduce land requirements [@Palmer-Wilson:2019]. If proven effective, these strategies can not only reduce negative side-effects, but also increase the feasibility of electricity systems with large shares of renewable electricity by reducing opposition.

In this article, I explore the impact that supply technology choice can have on total land requirements of fully renewable electricity systems in Europe. Renewable supply technologies have vastly different land requirements, with two orders of magnitude between the land requirements of bioenergy, the technology with the largest land requirements, and solar electricity, which has the lowest [@Smil:2015; @vanZalk:2018]. Former research shows that fully renewable electricity supply in Europe is possible in many different ways, with very different shares of supply technologies, and that cost between different designs must not vary much [@Schlachtberger:2017; @Neumann:2019; @Trondle:inreview]. However, while several studies have assessed cost [@Bussar:2014; @Connolly:2016; @Plessmann:2017; @Jacobson:2017; @Brown:2018; @Child:2019] and land requirements [@Fthenakis:2009; @Jacobson:2017; @Capellan-Perez:2017; @Trondle:2019] of supply technologies and entire electricity systems, only one study has assessed the relationship between the two on the system level [@Palmer-Wilson:2019]. The system perspective is central to renewable electricity systems as it takes into account not only the supply side but also technologies to handle fluctuations of the supply side. In their case study of Alberta, Canada, the authors find higher total system cost for lower thresholds of available land area even though they allow for significant amounts of electricity from non-renewable sources. No study has assessed the relationship between land requirements and cost on the system level using only renewable resources in Europe. I address the relationship in this study by determining cost-effective ways to reduce land requirements of fully renewable electricity systems in Europe through supply technology choice.

To find cost-effective ways to reduce land requirements, I do the following: I use a nationally resolved, dynamic model of the European electricity system to determine cost and land requirements of fully renewable supply. I find that while there is a trade-off between cost and land requirements, systems with vastly different requirements for land can be build for small cost penalties.

# Data and methods

To be able to identify cost-effective ways to reduce land requirements by supply technology choice, I generate total system cost and total land requirement data for fully renewable electricity supply in Europe with different shares of supply technologies using a model-based approach. I generate the data in two steps. First, I generate cost-minimised system designs for 286 different shares of supply technologies. Second, I determine total system cost and land requirements for each system design. Using the Monte Carlo method respecting uncertainty of technology parameters, I create 100,000 samples for each system design. In total, I end up with ~29 million observations of pairs of cost and land requirements. All data procedures and all analysis steps are publicly available <mark>(after peer-review; for reviewers provided as supplementary within the submission)</mark> as a Snakemake workflow [@Koster:2012].

The following subsections explain all data generation and analysis steps in more detail.

## Capacity shares of supply technologies

To understand how supply technology choice can mitigate land requirements of renewable electricity in Europe, I enforce different capacity shares of technologies in the system designs that I am analysing. The geographic scope of this study includes most countries with member organisations in the entso-e: EU-27, the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Norway, and Western Balkan countries. I focus on four dominant wind and solar supply technologies: on- and offshore wind, utility-scale, ground-mounted photovoltaics (PV) and roof-mounted PV. I analyse all 286 possible combinations based on ten different shares per technology, from 0% through 10% and 20% up to 100% (see @fig:shares). The shares are applied to the European level, but also to the national level, meaning that each country in Europe has to meet shares individually. Furthermore, I assume each country to be net self-sufficient, generating enough electricity annually to fulfil its domestic electricity demand but able to trade with other countries to balance renewable fluctuations.

![**Capacity shares of all 286 system designs for four supply technologies.** Pixels in each panel represent one system design. System designs are in no particular order. Shares of the same pixel in all panels always add to 100%.](report/supply-shares.png){#fig:shares .class}

Other than these four supply technologies, the system designs furthermore contain hydro electricity with and without reservoirs and bioenergy, both of which can generate renewable electricity to a limited extent as well. While I do not restrict their capacity shares, they are both restricted by their generation potential: hydro electricity is limited to the amount that can be generated using current capacities, and bioenergy is limited to the amount of bioenergy that can be generated from residuals (see System design model). Both contribute to electricity supply, but only to minor extents. Hydro electricity with reservoirs and bioenergy are used to balance renewable fluctuations as well.

Each country in Europe can potentially generate enough electricity from rooftop PV, utility-scale PV, and onshore wind to cover national demand together with limited generation from hydroelectricity and bioenergy (see System design model). Thus, system designs with 100% rooftop PV, 100% utility-scale PV, or 100% onshore wind are possible. The situation is different for offshore wind: while the generation potential for all Europe is large enough to cover European demand, only countries with shores can build offshore wind farms. In countries without shore I replace offshore wind with onshore wind; i.e. when all countries with shores have to enforce a 40% capacity share of offshore wind, and a 20% capacity share of onshore wind, all countries without shores have to have a 60% capacity share of onshore wind. Countries without shores, or with insufficient offshore potentials are: Austria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Switzerland, Czech Republic, Hungary, Luxembourg, Macedonia, Serbia, Slovakia, and Slovenia.

Based on the enforced supply capacity shares, the system design model determines absolute installed capacities in each country for all supply technologies, but also for all storage and international transmission capacities.

## System design model

The system design model determines cost-minimal system designs for Europe. The model is a network flow model with the electricity transmission grid at its core. Each country in Europe is modelled as a node on the network and all nodes are connected through the transmission grid. The model has a 4h resolution and simulates one full weather year to cover renewable fluctuations. It is a linear optimisation model that optimises system design and operation simultaneously. The model is implemented using the Calliope model framework [@Pfenninger:2018b] and has been used in a former publication. It is described in full detail in [@Trondle:inreview] (<mark>Currently under review and provided as supplementary within this submission.</mark>).

On the supply side, the model contains six renewable technologies to generate electricity: on- and offshore wind, utility-scale and rooftop PV, and hydroelectricity with and without reservoirs. Capacities are limited by their technical potentials, which I derive from [@Trondle:2019] for wind and solar power, and from [@Trondle:inreview] for hydroelectricity. For hydroelectricity, I assume no further expansion from today is possible, and thus its technical potential equates to today's capacity. For wind and solar power, I allow any capacity up to their technical potential. Generation profiles are based on weather data [@Dee:2011; @Pfenninger:2016; @Staffell:2016] and taken from the same sources as the potentials. Based on the enforced supply capacity shares, the system design model determines cost-minimal capacities of supply technologies.

To balance fluctuating hydro, solar, and wind generation, system designs contain battery storage, hydrogen storage, pumped storage hydroelectricity, and bioenergy. All storage technologies are modelled as single storage tanks with efficiencies, i.e. there is no flow of energy in any other form than electricity. Battery storage can discharge for a maximum of four hours at full power, while hydrogen storage can discharge for at least four hours. Bioenergy is limited by the amount of fuels that can be produced from residuals in each country per year [@RuizCastello:2015], i.e. I do not assume dedicated farming for energy crops. The limited fuel supply and high fuel cost make bioenergy a technology mainly used for balancing, rather than for supplying electricity. Bioenergy and storage capacities other than pumped hydro are not restricted in any way. I assume pumped storage hydroelectricity can not be expanded significantly and it is thus limited to today's capacities [@Trondle:inreview]. The system design model determines cost-minimal capacities of all balancing technologies.

All supply, balancing, and international transmission capacities have costs: overnight installation costs, annual maintenance costs, and variable costs (see @tbl:overview-cost-assumptions). The technology costs are important determinants of the magnitude of capacities chosen by the system design model. Their values are future projections and assume all technologies are deployed to large scale. Together with the technology lifetime, I determine annuities from these cost components. I uniformly assume cost of capital to be 7.3%, which has been the historic average [@Steffen:2019].

```

While future cost is uncertain, I am using expected values in the deterministic system design model. To cover the aspect that future cost is not know exactly, I handle cost uncertainties in the generation steps that follow the system design phase.

## Cost uncertainty

Cost of almost all components of future renewable electricity systems can be expected to fall compared to today. Cost falls with deployment as production processes get improved, product understanding increases with the use, and financing can be provided with lower overheads. Exactly how much cost will fall with deployment is not known, however. To cover this uncertainty, I am using minimum and maximum estimates of cost [@JRC:2014] of the four supply technologies analysed in this study. Because I do not have any other information about how likely any cost developments are, I am following the principle of maximum entropy and I am assuming a uniform distribution between minimum and maximum estimates in the following, see @tbl:overview-uncertain-parameters.

I only consider uncertainty in cost of on- and off-shore wind, and utility-scale and rooftop PV, first because these are the technologies whose cost-effectiveness I am assessing in this study. Second, because changes in their cost can have no impact on supply capacity shares which I enforce. Changes in cost of other technologies could lead to different designs, for example if hydrogen storage cost is much higher than the expected value, hydrogen may be replaced with bioenergy. For this reason, I use expected values only (see @tbl:overview-cost-assumptions) for all other components other than the four wind and solar supply technologies.

## Land requirements

To determine the land requirements of supply technologies, I assume capacities of technologies always to require the same amount of land and therefore apply a proportional constant to installed capacities: the inverse of capacity density, given in square meters per Watt. As the range of capacity density values given in the literature is large for onshore wind and utility-scale PV, I am using a stochastic approach here as well.

The land requirement of onshore wind in this study is the footprint of wind turbines together with the technically necessary spacing between turbines. While the spacing can be used for agriculture, it excludes other land uses and the spacing also does not reduce visual impacts. Thus, I include spacing in the land requirements of wind turbines in this study.

Theoretically, the capacity density of onshore wind can be high: based on technical specifications, it is up to 19\ W/m^2^ for the best turbines and ~10\ W/m^2^ on average [@McKenna:2015]. However, in deployed wind farms, the capacity density is much lower, with values between 2--10\ W/m^2^ [@Smil:2015; @vanZalk:2018; @Miller:2019; @Nitsch:2019]. This can have different reasons: the capacity density depends on the placement of turbines in the wind park and it depends on the technical specifications of the wind turbine. More importantly, because land is not the most important cost component of wind farms, farms are not necessarily build in a way to maximise capacity density. In this study, I am using a capacity density estimate taken from [@vanZalk:2018] based on measurements in the US. Here, the authors found 8.8\ W/m^2^ on average with a standard deviation of ~2\ W/m^2^, see @tbl:overview-uncertain-parameters.

Uncertainty about land requirements of utility-scale PV is similarly high. Around 40%--50% of the area of solar farms is covered by modules [@Turney:2011; @Smil:2015; @Wirth:2017], while the rest of the land is used for inverters, power lines, spacing, and roads. In addition, the technology used, orientation, and efficiency of the PV modules have great impact on land requirements as well as they determine the capacity installable on the area covered by modules. Theoretically derived capacity densities using today's module efficiencies are in the range of 80--100\ W/m^2^ [@Wirth:2017], but measurements from the US show much lower estimates of 20--30\ W/m^2^ only [@Smil:2015; @vanZalk:2018; @Miller:2019]. A recent study from Germany shows, however, that the capacity density of German utility-scale PV has increased drastically over time: in less than 20 years, it increased by factor 3 to ~70\ W/m^2^ in 2018 [@ZSW:2019]. The authors explain the trend not only by increasing module efficiencies, but also by more economic use of land. These findings show that theoretically derived capacity densities may actually be more accurate for future projections than historic measurements, and I am therefore using capacity densities derived from theory. I am assuming that land is covered to 40--50% by modules [@Turney:2011; @Smil:2015; @Wirth:2017], and that module efficiency is between 17.5--22% [@Wirth:2020], see @tbl:overview-uncertain-parameters. Assuming a uniform distribution for both, this leads to an expected capacity density value of utility-scale PV of ~88\ W/m^2^.

The remaining two supply technologies, rooftop PV and offshore wind, have no land requirements whatsoever. Rooftop PV is built on existing structures, and offshore wind is not built on land. This makes them promising options for reducing total land requirements of renewable electricity systems.

Hydroelectricity, bioenergy, storage, and transmission will all require land which I am not analysing in detail in this study. The reasons for me to ignore land requirements of each of the components are the following: First, I do not analyse footprints of hydroelectricity in detail, because system designs in this study all contain the exact amount that is installed today. Thus, hydroelectricity's land requirements in all cases is the same, and it is equal to today's. Today's footprint is not insignificant, however. It is dominated by the extent of its water reservoirs [@Smil:2015], which span roughly 50,000\ km^2^ (1% of total land) in Europe [@Halleraker:2016]. Not all of the reservoirs in Europe are used for electricity generation, and even less are used exclusively for it [@Halleraker:2016], so this total number can be seen as an upper bound of the land requirements of hydroelectricity.

Second, land requirements of bioenergy are very small as long as only residuals are used for fuel production. When dedicated energy crops are farmed, bioenergy has the lowest capacity density of all renewable technologies [@vanZalk:2018]. The by far largest contribution to its land requirements stems from fields for crop farming, however. Because I allow only residuals to be used for electricity generation, land requirements equate to the footprint of power plants only, which leads to a capacity density in the order of 10^4^\ W/m^2^ [@Smil:2015] and thus 2--3 orders of magnitude larger than solar and wind power. This makes bioenergy's contribution to total system land requirements insignificant and I am therefore ignoring it in this study.

Third, land requirements of electricity storage depend on the amount of electricity that must be stored. Commercial suppliers offer 1 MW / 1 MWh battery storage systems in standardised container enclosings today [@Aggreko:2020], leading to a capacity density in the order of 10^5^\ W/m^2^ and 10^5^\ Wh/m^2^. Power-wise, a capacity density of this magnitude makes the land requirements of battery storage insignificant compared to the one of solar and wind power, even if spacing, roads and further infrastructure must be added. Energy-wise, capacity density cannot be compared to solar and wind power, and the total land requirements depend on the amount of electricity that must be stored in batteries. This is equally true for hydrogen storage. Here, the energy-wise capacity density depends on how hydrogen is stored. Hydrogen has a low energy density of 3\ kWh/m^3^ if stored uncompressed at normal conditions. It can be stored underground in salt caverns, or overground in steel tanks. Capacity density is lowest if hydrogen is stored in such overground tanks in uncompressed form. Together with a conservative height of the tanks of 2\ meters, this equals 6,000\ Wh/m^2^. This conservative estimation is worse than the one for battery storage. Because much more electricity is anticipated to be stored as hydrogen rather than in batteries, total land requirements of hydrogen storage may be high, if it is not stored in compressed forms, in tanks taller than 2\ meters, or underground, and if large amounts must be stored. The latter is not the case for the system designs I am considering in this study (see "Storage and flexible generation require insignificant amounts of land" in results section), and thus I am ignoring land requirements of battery storage and hydrogen storage.

Lastly, the transmission grid already today has significant land requirements, which will likely increase in fully renewable systems. Currently, there are 480,000\ km of AC transmission lines in the entso-e grid [@ENTSO-E:2019]. With an estimated 13.5\ m buffer zone on each side [@Stevens:2017], this leads to 13,000\ km^2^ (0.3%) of land required. A former study found that fully renewable electricity requires roughly a doubling of the transmission capacity when countries are net self-sufficient [@Trondle:inreview], as they are in this study. Considering power per line remains the same as it is today, their scenario would require 25,000\ km^2^ (0.5%) of European land for transmission lines. Despite these numbers, I am not assessing the land requirements of transmission in this study. The spatial resolution of this study, the national level, is too high to determine necessary land for transmission.

## Stochastic model

I use technology cost and technology land requirement parameters to derive total system cost and total land requirements of solar and wind power in all 286 system designs stemming from the system design phase. I do this in two steps. First, I sample 100,000 times from the input uncertainties using Saltelli’s extension of the Sobol sequence [@Herman:2017] to derive a sufficiently large sample set of the seven dimensional input space. Second, for each sample and each system design I derive total land requirements of solar and wind power by applying the inverse of capacity density to the installed capacity in the system design. Similarly, I derive total system cost by scaling technology cost of solar and wind from the system design with the factors given from the input sample. This leads to ~29 million observations of pairs of cost and land requirements, which I am using to analyse cost effectiveness of different supply technologies.

# Results

## Renewable electricity supply with vastly different land requirements

Among all ~29 million observations, cost of electricity in all Europe is between 0.06 and 0.10\ EUR per kWh consumed while land requirements of solar and wind power are between 0% and 3% of total European land mass (see @fig:observations). These ranges include all possible cases of supply share combinations, including systems supplied, apart from hydroelectricity and bioenergy, exclusively from onshore wind, utility-scale PV, and rooftop PV, or with high shares of offshore wind. The ranges furthermore contain technology cost and technology land requirement parameters from the full range of their uncertainty. The observations show that European electricity systems with vastly different land requirements are possible at cost never exceeding twice the lowest cost.

When I reduce uncertainty distributions to their expected values (their means) I find that there is a trade-off between expected land requirements of renewable electricity and its expected cost. Among all 286 system designs with different supply shares, a system with only onshore wind and utility-scale PV has the lowest expected cost of around 0.07\ EUR per kWh consumed and requires 2% of Europe's total land mass (~97,000\ km^2^) -- an area roughly the size of Portugal. Cost is minimal when both technologies contribute 50% to the total capacity of wind and solar technologies. While higher shares of utility-scale PV decrease land requirements, they also increase cost (see right flanks in {@fig:ternary}a,b). Higher shares of onshore wind increase both cost and land requirements. A system design with only onshore wind has the highest expected land requirements (see top corner of {@fig:ternary}b). Rooftop PV has the largest potential to decrease land requirements, as it requires no additional land, but it also increases cost the most (see left corners of {@fig:ternary}a,b).

Electricity system designs with offshore wind in addition to onshore wind and utility-scale PV have significantly lower cost when they do not include rooftop PV (see {@fig:ternary}c). The potential of offshore wind to decrease land requirements is smaller than the one of rooftop PV, but only slightly (see {@fig:ternary}d). While offshore wind requires no additional land -- similar to rooftop PV -- it is not available in every country in Europe and is replaced by onshore wind in these places. Compared to onshore wind, the land requirements of all other three supply technologies -- offshore wind, utility-scale PV, and rooftop PV -- are significantly lower and thus, system designs with large shares of any of these alternatives have significantly smaller total land requirements, albeit at higher cost.

## Offshore wind reduces land requirements most cost-effectively

The rather large expected land requirements of the cost-minimal case can be reduced most cost-effectively by replacing onshore wind with offshore wind. In this way, total land requirements of renewable electricity can be reduced by 50% (to 1% of total land) for a cost penalty of 5% (see {@fig:technology}a). This cost penalty corresponds to 0.22\ EUR per m^2^ and year and requires a share of offshore wind of ~25%. Land requirements can be decreased further, in total by 85%, with higher shares of offshore wind. However, cost increase sharply for the last minor reductions in land, for which utility-scale PV must be phased out (see two left-most points in {@fig:technology}a).

![**Cost-effective ways to reduce expected land requirements using supply technologies individually.** All panels show expected cost and expected land requirements of all 286 system designs in light blue in the background. **a,b,c,** Dark blue cases show Pareto-optimal decreases of land requirements from cost-minimal case using offshore wind only (**a**), utility-scale PV only (**b**), and rooftop PV only (**c**).](report/land-use/technology.svg){#fig:technology .class}

Reducing land requirements with utility-scale (see {@fig:technology}b) and rooftop PV (see {@fig:technology}c) has higher cost. To reach the same reduced land requirements of 50% below the cost-minimal case (1% of total land) higher shares of utility-scale PV lead to a cost penalty of ~10%, corresponding to 0.43\ EUR per m^2^ and year. Cost rises progressively however, and early decreases of land requirements have very low cost. In total, 80% of the cost-minimal land requirements can be removed with a cost penalty of 23% using utility-scale PV only. 

The highest expected cost comes with phasing-in rooftop PV. Here, reducing land requirements by one square meter requires 0.77 EUR per year when reducing cost-minimal requirements by 50% (to 1% of total land, see {@fig:technology}c) -- this is a cost penalty of 17%. Similar to utility-scale PV, the cost increases with higher rooftop shares and the largest increase can be explained by the technology that is phased-out: the first half of rooftop PV replaces onshore wind, while the second half replaces utility-scale PV at a much higher cost. The increase of offshore wind, utility-scale PV, and rooftop PV shares always reduces expected land requirements of fully renewable electricity systems, albeit at different cost.

## Cost penalties of 20% or less are most likely even for low land requirements

Uncertainty in technology cost and land requirements leads to high uncertainty in the cost penalties for renewable electricity with lower land requirements. To ensure land requirements are below 1% of total European land, cost penalties can be as large as 40%, but are most likely below 20% for all supply technology options (see @fig:land-threshold). For offshore wind and utility-scale PV a cost penalty below 20% can be expected in 75% of the cases. In a quarter of all cases, there is no cost penalty necessary at all, because the cost-optimal case has land requirements of 1% or lower. With lower thresholds, cost penalties become more likely and also larger. For a threshold of 0.5% of European land, a cost penalty of 20% is still more likely for the more cost-effective technologies offshore wind and utility-scale PV.

![**Resulting cost penalties to ensure land thresholds.** The cost penalty arises from higher than cost-minimal shares of one of three supply technologies: offshore wind, utility-scale PV, or rooftop PV. The uncertainty distribution of cost penalties is displayed using letter-value plots. Letter-value plots are an extension to boxplots for large data. Dark grey lines indicate the median value of the cost penalties, and the largest boxes above and below the median visualise the 25--75% quantiles. Each following box contains half as many observations as the box closer to the median. The extreme 1% of the observations are considered outliers and marked with rhombs.](report/land-use/boxenplot-absolute.png){#fig:land-threshold .class}

The uncertainty does not alter the order of cost-effectiveness of the three supply technologies with low land requirements: rooftop PV is always the least cost-effective technology. Offshore wind is most cost-effective, but only when large amounts of onshore wind are replaced by it (see land area thresholds of 1% or smaller in @fig:land-threshold). In these cases, offshore wind is more cost-effective than utility-scale PV. For medium land thresholds (1.5%), expected value of cost and its distribution are nearly the same for both technologies. Above that, as long as land area is to be reduced only little, utility-scale PV is the most cost-effective option.

## Low land requirements require low shares of onshore wind

While land needs of supply technologies are uncertain, onshore wind is in any case the technology with the highest requirements for land if spacing is included. Offshore wind, utility-scale PV, and rooftop PV are therefore no-regret options to reduce the spatial extent of renewable electricity generation on land. In 50% of the cases, a land threshold of 1% of total European land can only be reached if the capacity share of onshore wind is 40% or below (see @fig:wind), and if there are no additional land requirements of utility-scale PV. When there are additional land requirements of utility-scale PV, onshore wind capacity must be even lower, and if utility-scale PV is the only alternative, onshore wind capacity must be as low as 10%. Renewable electricity with low requirements for land can only be reached by low shares of onshore wind.

![**Maximal capacity shares of onshore wind to ensure land thresholds.** Visualised shares are the maximum shares among system designs with only utility-scale PV or only rooftop PV and offshore wind in addition to onshore wind and given uncertainty.

## Storage and flexible generation require small amounts of land

Systems with different shares of solar and wind capacity require different balancing capacity in terms of electricity storage, bioenergy, and transmission. Balancing needs are moderate for cases with balanced mixes of supply technologies (@fig:flexibility). When supply is strongly biased towards one technology, flexibility needs rise, and in some cases they rise sharply. Exclusively- or almost exclusively-solar cases require high amounts of short-term (battery) electricity storage. In the extreme case, storage capacities alone are able to fulfil the largest part of Europe's peak demand. Short-term storage capacities in these cases are combined with very high magnitudes of bioenergy capacity of up to 50% of peak demand to balance solar's seasonal fluctuations. Cases with mainly wind require much less bioenergy capacity and short-term storage capacity, but significantly more long-term storage capacities to balance wind fluctuations between days and weeks. In addition, they require around 2.5 times larger international transmission capacity than solar systems. While some of these numbers are very high, especially for cases with single supply technologies, there is no reason to believe these balancing capacities could not be built.

![**Flexibility needs of fully renewable electricity systems with all possible shares of three different supply technologies.** All designs are exclusively supplied from hydroelectricity of today's capacity and different shares of three additional technologies each: onshore wind and utility-scale PV in all cases, combined with either rooftop PV (top row) or offshore wind (bottom row). Each technology is varied from 0--100% of the total capacity of the three technologies. **a,b,c,d,** Storage power capacity (**a**), storage energy capacity (**b**), international transmission capacity (**c**), and bioenergy capacity (**d**). Not shown are hydroelectricity capacities which are kept constant in all cases (36\ GW run of river, 103\ GW / 97\ TWh reservoirs, 54\ GW / 1.3\ TWh pumped hydro storage).](report/flexibility.svg){#fig:flexibility .class}

Balancing capacities require land as well and thus add to the land requirements of the entire electricity system. The transmission grid will likely require a significant amount of land. In its current state, it uses an estimated 0.3% of total land (see Methods). For the system designs in this study I can not determine land requirements of the transmission grid, as the spatial resolution is too low to generate estimations. 

The land requirements of all other balancing technologies are very small, however. When considering 10^5^\ Wh/m^2^ for battery storage capacity, a conservative 6,000\ Wh/m^2^ for hydrogen storage capacity, and 10^4^\ W/m^2^ for bioenergy capacity (see Methods), total land requirements of all three flexibility technologies are always below 1,800\ km^2^ (0.04% of total European land). Within this estimate, the by far largest contribution comes from hydrogen, for which I use an upper-bound estimation (stored uncompressed in overground tanks). If hydrogen is stored land efficiently in underground caverns, flexibility needs of all three technologies can rise by orders of magnitude without making a significant contribution to total land requirements of fully renewable electricity systems.

# Discussion

## Comparison to other studies

Previous studies found lower potentials of renewable generation or higher land requirements than the ones I am considering. In the following, I discuss the potential impact this may have on the three supply-side options to reduce land requirements of fully renewable electricity supply: offshore wind, rooftop PV, and utility-scale PV.

The system design with highest generation of **offshore wind** in this study generates 2,400\ TWh/a in offshore areas which is not in conflict with previous studies. The European Environment Agency estimated the potential of offshore wind in 2030 to be 3,400\ TWh/a [@EuropeanEnvironmentAgency:2009], even if the technical potential is constrained strongly. More recently, two studies estimated the potential to be as large as 40,000\ TWh/a [@Caglayan:2019] or even 50,000\ TWh/a [@IEA:2019]. Given these potential estimations, there is no reason to believe high capacity shares of offshore wind would not be possible.

**Rooftop PV** generates up to 1,800\ TWh/a in this study. Other estimations for the potential of photovoltaics on roofs and façades are lower: 680\ TWh/a for only rooftop PV [@Bodis:2019a] and 1200 --2100\  TWh for rooftop PV and PV on façades [@Ruiz:2019]. Should the lower estimations be correct, very high shares of rooftop PV as considered in this study may not be possible. This does not diminish the potential of rooftop PV to reduce land requirements with lower shares, however. High shares are in any case less attractive, as I show in my results, due to high cost and high balancing requirements.

Lastly, up to 1,800\ TWh/a are generated by **utility-scale PV** when its capacity share is the highest. While this does not exceed potential estimations in the literature [@Capellan-Perez:2017; @Ruiz:2019], there are conflicting estimations about how much land renewable supply using only photovoltaics will require. In this study, a system based on utility-scale PV requires expected 0.38% of total European land. While Ruiz et al. [@Ruiz:2019] find a similar estimate (0.46%), one previous study by Capellán-Pérez et al. [@Capellan-Perez:2017] finds that land requirements of supply using PV only are more than 10 times higher: 8% of total European land. The large deviation can be explained mainly by two differences: First, they consider areas larger than the fenced areas of PV farms, leading to capacity shares being two times smaller than in this study and in Ruiz et al. [@Ruiz:2019]. Whether such areas should be included is questioned [@Smil:2015]. Using their capacity shares would lead to higher cost penalties of land reductions stemming from utility-scale PV. 

Second, Capellán-Pérez et al. estimate required overcapacities due to seasonal fluctuations to be large: in France and Portugal, for example, they assume 250% and 380% are necessary. Their assumption leads to PV capacities and land requirements that are 4 and 6 times larger than in my study, where fluctuations are handled by European balancing through the transmission grid and by flexible generation from bioenergy. Compared to overcapacities, these balancing options require not only less land but are also less costly. This shows the importance of a holistic system perspective taking into account not only the supply side but also the balancing side.

## Limitations

The high level perspective on land requirements in this study allows to understand the full spatial extent of electricity supply infrastructure on European land and its trade-off with cost. Land requirements of the different technologies, however, are not always directly comparable. For example, while solar photovoltaics does not allow for any other land use -- at least not as long as agrophotovoltaics is unavailable at large scale [@Weselek:2019] -- the vast spacing between wind turbines does allow for agriculture. Thus, the two technologies compete differently with other uses of land. Offshore wind of course requires no land, but competes with other uses of offshore areas. Further, the potential to devaluate land and landscapes is perceived differently for different technologies. For example, onshore wind farms are perceived more negatively than utility-scale PV [@Setton:2019]. Because I analyse total land requirements in this study, I cannot account for these qualitative differences. However, I mitigate this limitation by making options to reduce land requirements technology-specific.

# Conclusion

I show that fully renewable electricity in Europe is possible with vastly different amounts of land required for solar and wind power, and that reducing land requirements does not necessarily lead to substantial cost penalties. The expected land requirements of a system design with minimal expected cost is 97,000\ km^2^ (2% total European land). Such a low-cost system is supplied, apart from hydroelectricity and bioenergy from residuals, only from onshore wind farms and utility-scale photovoltaics (PV). Its expected land requirements can be reduced by increasing the share of utility-scale PV, or by phasing-in offshore wind or rooftop PV. Offshore wind is the most cost-effective option of these three possibilities. It can decrease cost-minimal land requirements by 50% for an expected cost penalty of only 5%. Utility-scale and rooftop PV can lead to the same effect for cost penalties of 10% and 17%. All three technologies can reduce land requirements more than 50% for higher cost penalties by replacing larger amounts of onshore wind capacity.

Because cost and land requirements of wind and solar power are not known with certainty, total system cost and total land requirements of renewable electricity supply in Europe is uncertain as well. Ensuring land requirements lower than 1% of total European land (50% of the cost-minimal case) can thus require cost penalties as large as 40%. Despite these uncertainties, three main findings are robust: First, onshore wind always requires the most amount of land and thus a switch to any other technology to reduce land is a no-regret option. Second, offshore wind is always the most cost-effective option, followed by utility-scale PV, and rooftop PV. Third, reducing land requirements of fully renewable electricity in Europe does likely not come with high cost: cost penalties of 20% or less are most likely for a system with low land requirements of 1% of European land through sufficient shares of offshore wind, utility-scale PV, or rooftop PV.

Considering all uncertainty and all possible system designs, land requirements of solar and wind power are in the range of 0--3% of total European land. Significant contributions to the land needs of electricity supply can be expected from the transmission grid and hydroelectricity (~0.5% and <1%, see Methods). The total land requirements of fully renewable electricity is thus likely within the range of 1.5--4.5%.

My findings show that supply technology choice is an effective way to reduce land requirements of fully renewable electricity systems in Europe. Systems with vastly different land requirements can be designed, and their cost must not vary much as long as land requirements are reduced cost-effectively. Instead of relying strongly on onshore wind, which is likely the cost-minimal solution, electricity can be generated offshore at large scale and be transported to demand centres using a sufficient transmission grid. The expansion of both, onshore wind farms and transmission grid can be limited by alternatively generating solar electricity locally. Such a solar-centred electricity supply is enabled by flexible generation from bioenergy to cope with seasonal fluctuations. These findings increase the solution space for a European energy transition and allow to integrate more diverse stakeholder positions than is possible with cost minimised electricity system designs.
