![**Cost and land use of fully renewable electricity systems with different shares of rooftop PV, utility-scale PV, and onshore wind.** All systems contain no offshore wind capacity. **a,** Total system cost relative to minimal total system cost. **b,** Land use relative to land use of the minimal-cost case.](report/land-use/ternary-roof.svg){#fig:ternary-land-use-roof .class}

![**Cost and land use of fully renewable electricity systems with different shares of rooftop PV, utility-scale PV, and onshore wind.** All systems contain no offshore wind capacity. Cost is relative to minimal cost. Land use is relative to land use of the minimal-cost case. **a,** Cost and land use of all cases. The red line indicates the Pareto frontier on which neither cost nor land use can be reduced without increasing the respective other. **b,** Cost and land use of all cases. Darker colours indicate the share of rooftop PV (top), utility-scale PV (middle), and onshore wind (bottom).](report/land-use/scatter-roof.svg){#fig:scatter-land-use-roof .class}

## Flexibility needs

![**Flexibility needs for all analysed electricity system designs.** All designs are exclusively supplied from today's hydropower capacity and different shares of three additional technologies each: onshore wind and utility-scale PV in all cases, combined with rooftop PV (top row) and offshore wind (bottom row). Each technology is varied from 0--100% of the total capacity of the three technologies. **a,b,c,d,** Storage power capacity (**a**), storage energy capacity (**b**), international transmission capacity (**c**), and bioenergy capacity (**d**). Not shown are hydropower capacities which are kept constant in all cases (36 GW run of river, 103 GW / 97 TWh reservoirs, 54 GW / 1.3 TWh pumped hydro storage).](report/flexibility.svg){#fig:flexibility .class}
