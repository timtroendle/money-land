# Introduction

Europe has the potential to generate all its electricity from renewable sources [@EuropeanEnvironmentAgency:2009a; @McKenna:2015; @Jacobson:2017; @Ruiz:2019; @Trondle:2019; @Bodis:2019a; @IEA:2019; @Caglayan:2019]. The potential provides an avenue to largely or completely decarbonise the European electricity system, which is a necessary step to reach the European Commission's own goal of becoming a climate-neutral economy by 2050 [@EuropeanCommission:2018]. A transition to renewable electricity will likely increase the total land use of electricity supply however and, depending on which aspects are factored in, it may even do so by orders of magnitude. 

The predominant forms of electricity supply based on fossil and nuclear fuels generally have small footprints [@MacKay:2008; @Smil:2015; @Stevens:2017; @vanZalk:2018]. Their hunger for land is even smaller in Europe considering that Europe imports the larger part of fossil and nuclear fuels [@PublicationsOfficeoftheEuropeanUnion:2017] and that mining for fuel contributes the most to the land use of this kind of electricity [@Smil:2015; @Stevens:2017]. Renewable electricity generally has a higher land use [@MacKay:2008; @Smil:2015; @Stevens:2017; @vanZalk:2018] incurring entirely within Europe if electricity is not imported. It is thus likely that a transition to renewable source increases the total amount of land that is impacted by the electricity system.

While renewable electricity is an indispensable means to mitigate climate change globally, its high land requirements have the potential to cause conflicts locally where it is built. This is for three reasons. First, it may compete with other land uses. Of the main two current technologies of renewable electricity, photovoltaics and wind turbines, only the latter allows for limited dual use of land: for technical reasons, spacing between turbines is rather large and, as a result, spacing can be used for agriculture, but only for agriculture [@Smil:2015]. Second, generation infrastructure can negatively impact ecosystems. A review from 2017 [@Gasparatos:2017] concludes that not all relationships between solar and wind power and biodiversity are known yet, but that habitat losses and habitat changes are certainly among the negative ones. Third, renewable generation infrastructure has the potential to devaluate land on which it is built, and also neighbouring land. There is conflicting evidence whether wind power in sight of properties can impact property values, and while the majority of studies does not find statistically significant impacts, some others find losses in property values of up to 15% [@Brinkley:2019]. Wind [@Molnarova:2012] and solar power [@Sanchez-Pantoja:2018] can be perceived as negatively impacting the landscape, depending on place attachment and the aesthetics of the previously undisturbed landscape [@Devine-Wright:2010; @Molnarova:2012; @deVries:2012], location and density of structures [@Molnarova:2012], but importantly also as a result of procedural aspects [@Zoellner:2008; @Hoen:2019]. 

Despite the negative impacts of renewable electricity and its high land use, acceptance of the energy transition is high and the majority of the population does not feel disturbed by wind and solar installations [@Knebel:2016; @Setton:2019]. Still, opposition towards local renewable electricity projects has hindered and postponed projects in the past [@Stokes:2016; @Spath:2018] (MORE SOURCES) and may continue to do so in the future, in particular considering the significant expansion of land use moving towards fully decarbonised electricity supply. This led some authors to the conclusion that fully renewable electricity -- while being theoretically possible -- will not be feasible in Europe [@MacKay:2008; @Smil:2015].

There are strategies to mitigate negative impacts associated to the land use of renewable electricity. When proving effective, these strategies can not only reduce negative side-effects, but also increase the feasibility of electricity systems with large shares of renewable electricity. Most of the strategies fall into one of the following categories: location and placement of generation infrastructure [@Molnarova:2012; @Gasparatos:2017], decreasing density of generation infrastructure [@Gasparatos:2017; @Setton:2019], technological developments [@Gasparatos:2017], community involvement during project development phase [@Zoellner:2008; @Schroeter:2016; @Susser:2017], and lastly technology choice [@Palmer-Wilson:2019]. Due to the partially complex and conflicting dependency between different negative effects, none of the strategies alone may be able to mitigate all negative impacts simultaneously. For example, decreasing the density of wind parks may be an effective measure to mitigate annoyance of residents [@Molnarova:2012; @Setton:2019]. Lower density wind parks have a higher land use, however, and therefore increase conflicts with other land use and increase impacts on ecosystems. A combination of several measures is therefore necessary to make a difference.

In this article, I explore the impact that supply technology choice can have on total land use of fully renewable electricity systems in Europe. Renewable supply technologies have vastly different land requirements, with two orders of magnitude between the land requirements of bioenergy, the technology with the largest footprint, and solar electricity, which has the lowest footprint [@Smil:2015; @vanZalk:2018]. Former research shows that fully renewable electricity supply in Europe is possible in many different ways, with very different shares of supply technologies, and that cost between different designs must not vary much [@Schlachtberger:2017; @Neumann:2019; @Trondle:inreview]. However, while several studies have assessed cost [@Bussar:2014; @Connolly:2016; @Plessmann:2017; @Jacobson:2017; @Brown:2018; @Child:2019] and land use [@Fthenakis:2009; @Jacobson:2017; @Trondle:2019] of supply technologies and entire electricity systems, only one study has assessed the relationship between the two on the system level [@Palmer-Wilson:2019]. The system perspective is central to renewable electricity systems as it takes into account not only the supply side but also technologies to balance renewable fluctuations. In their case study of Alberta, Canada, the authors find higher total system cost for lower land uses even though they allow for significant amounts of electricity from non-renewable sources. No study has assessed the relationship between land use and cost on the system level using only renewable resources in Europe. I address the relationship in this study by determining cost-effective ways to reduce land use of renewable supply infrastructure in fully renewable electricity systems in Europe.

To find cost-effective ways to reduce land use, I do the following: I use a nationally resolved, dynamic, and cost-minimising model of the European electricity system to determine cost and land use of fully renewable supply. I analyse 286 distinct shares of four supply technologies: onshore and offshore wind, and utility-scale and rooftop PV. The optimisation model determines the cost-optimal total amount of supply and balancing technologies. Taking into account uncertainty in cost and land use parameters, I use the results of the 286 runs to identify the cost-effectiveness in reducing land use of the supply technologies.

# Data and methods

To be able to identify cost-effective ways to reduce land use by supply technology choice, I generate total system cost and total land use data for fully renewable electricity supply in Europe with different shares of supply technologies using a model-based approach. I generate the data in two steps. First, I generate cost-minimised system designs of fully renewable electricity in Europe. A system design consists of renewable supply capacity, capacities to balance renewable supply, and international transmission capacity. I derive system designs for 286 different combinations of shares of four renewable supply technologies: onshore wind, offshore wind, utility-scale PV, and rooftop PV. I may, for example, enforce a system with 40% rooftop PV and 60% onshore wind. For all technology cost inheriting uncertainty, I use expected values in the system design model. Second, I determine total system cost and land use for all 286 system designs. In this step, I am applying a stochastic model that considers uncertainty in cost and land use parameters of supply technologies. I use the Monte Carlo method to sample 100,000 times from the model and determine uncertainty in total system cost and land use for each system design. In total, I end up with ~29 million observations of pairs of cost and land use. All data procedures and all analysis steps are publicly available <mark>(after peer-review)</mark> as a Snakemake workflow [@Koster:2012].

I use the observations to show whether there is a trade-off between cost and land use and if yes, which technology choice options exist to reduce land use of fully renewable electricity systems. The following subsections explain all data generation and analysis steps in more detail.

## Capacity shares of supply technologies

To understand how supply technology choice can mitigate land use in Europe, I enforce different capacity shares of technologies in the system designs that I am analysing. The geographic scope of this study includes all countries with member organisations in the entso-e, excluding Iceland, Cyprus, and Turkey: EU-27, the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Norway, and Western Balkan countries. I focus on four main supply technologies based on wind and solar: on- and offshore wind, utility-scale photovoltaics (PV) and rooftop PV. I analyse all 286 possible combinations based on ten different shares per technology, from 0% through 10% and 20% up to 100%. The shares are valid on the European level, but also on the national level, meaning that each country in Europe has to maintain shares individually. Furthermore, I assume each country to be net self-sufficient, generating enough electricity annually to fulfil its domestic electricity demand.

Other than these four supply technologies, the system designs furthermore contain hydro electricity and bioenergy, both of which can generate renewable electricity to a limited extent as well. While I do not restrict their capacity shares, they are both restricted by their generation potential: hydro electricity is limited to current capacities, and bioenergy is limited to the amount of biofuels that can be generated from residuals (see System design model). Both contribute to electricity supply, but only to minor extents.

Each country in Europe can potentially generate enough electricity from rooftop PV, utility-scale PV, and onshore wind to cover national demand together with limited generation from hydroelectricity and bioenergy (see System design model). Thus, system designs with 100% rooftop PV, 100% utility-scale PV, or 100% onshore wind are possible. The situation is different for offshore wind: while the generation potential for all Europe is large enough to cover European demand, only countries with shores can build offshore wind farms. In countries without shore I replace offshore wind with onshore wind; i.e. when all countries with shores have to enforce a 40% capacity share of offshore wind, and a 20% capacity share of onshore wind, all countries without shores have to have a 60% capacity share of onshore wind. Countries without shores, or with insufficient offshore potentials are: Austria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Switzerland, Czech Republic, Hungary, Luxembourg, Macedonia, Serbia, Slovakia, and Slovenia.

Based on the enforced supply capacity shares, the system design model determines absolute installed capacities in each country for all supply technologies, but also for all storage and international transmission capacities.

## System design model

The system design model determines cost-minimal system designs for all Europe. The model is a network flow model with the electricity transmission grid at its core. Each country in Europe is modelled as a node on the network and all nodes are connected through the transmission grid. The model has a 4h resolution and simulates one full weather year to cover renewable fluctuations. It is a linear optimisation model that optimises system design and operation simultaneously. The model is implemented using the Calliope model framework [@Pfenninger:2018b] and has been used in a former publication. It is described in full detail in [@Trondle:inreview].

On the supply side, the model contains six renewable technologies to generate electricity: on- and offshore wind, utility-scale and rooftop PV, and hydroelectricity with and without reservoirs. Capacities are limited by their technical potentials, which I derive from [@Trondle:2019] for wind and solar power, and from [@Trondle:inreview] for hydroelectricity. For hydroelectricity, I assume no further expansion from today is possible, and thus its technical potential equates to today's capacity. For wind and solar power, I ignore today's capacities and allow any capacity up to their technical potential. Generation profiles are based on weather data [@Dee:2011; @Pfenninger:2016; @Staffell:2016] and derived from the same sources as the potentials. Based on the enforced supply capacity shares, the system design model determines cost-minimal capacities of supply technologies.

To balance fluctuating hydro, solar, and wind generation, system designs contain battery storage, hydrogen storage, pumped storage hydroelectricity, and bioenergy. All storage technologies are modelled as single storage tanks with efficiencies, i.e. there is no flow of energy in any other form than electricity. Battery storage is limited in a way that it can discharge for a maximum of four hours at full power, while hydrogen storage must be able to do the same for at least four hours. Bioenergy is limited by the amount of fuels that can be produced from residuals in each country per year [@RuizCastello:2015], i.e. I do not assume dedicated farming for energy crops. The limited fuel supply allows bioenergy to contribute only little to fulfilling electricity demand. Bioenergy and storage capacities other than pumped hydro are not restricted in any way. I assume pumped storage hydroelectricity can not be expanded significantly and it is thus limited to today's capacities [@Trondle:inreview]. The system design model determines cost-minimal capacities of all balancing technologies.

All supply, balancing, and international transmission capacities come with cost: overnight installation cost, annual maintenance cost, and variable cost (see Table @tbl:overview-cost-assumptions). The technology costs are important determinants of the magnitude of capacities chosen by the system design model. Their values are future projections and assume all technologies are deployed to large scale. Together with the technology lifetime, I determine annuities from these cost components. I uniformly assume cost of capital to be 7.3%, which has been the historic average [@Steffen:2019].

While cost is uncertain, I am using expected values in the deterministic system design model. To cover the aspect that future cost can not be foreseen, I handle cost uncertainties in the generation steps that follow the system design phase.

## Cost uncertainty

Cost of almost all components of future renewable electricity systems can be expected to fall compared to today. Cost falls with deployment as production processes get improved, product understanding increases with the use, and financing can be provided with lower overheads. Exactly how much cost will fall with deployment is not known, however. To cover this uncertainty, I am using minimum and maximum estimates of cost [@JRC:2014] of the four supply technologies analysed in this study. Because I do not have any other information about how likely any cost developments are, I am following the principle of maximum entropy and I am assuming a uniform distribution between minimum and maximum estimates in the following, see Table @tbl:overview-uncertain-parameters.

I only consider uncertainty in cost of on- and off-shore wind, and utility-scale and rooftop PV, first because these are the technologies whose cost-effectiveness I am assessing in this study. Second, because I control their shares in the system design model in which I apply expected values and thus changes in their cost has little impact on system designs. Changes in cost of other technologies could lead to different designs, for example if hydrogen storage cost are much higher than the expected value, hydrogen could be replaced with bioenergy. For this reason, I am using expected values only (see Table @tbl:overview-cost-assumptions) for all other components other than the four wind and solar supply technologies.

## Land use

To determine the land use of supply technologies, I assume capacities of technologies always to require the same amount of land and therefore apply a proportional constant to installed capacities: the inverse of capacity density given in square meters per Watt. As the range of capacity density values given in the literature is large for onshore wind and utility-scale PV, I am using a stochastic approach here as well.

The land requirement of onshore wind I am considering in this study is the footprint of wind turbines together with the technically necessary spacing between turbines. While the spacing can be used for agriculture, it excludes other land uses and the spacing also does not reduce land devaluation as discussed above. Thus, I include spacing in the land use of wind turbines in this study.

Theoretically, the capacity density of onshore wind can be high: based on technical specifications, it is up to 19 W/m^2^ for the best turbines and ~10 W/m^2^ on average [@McKenna:2015]. However, in deployed wind farms, the capacity density is much lower, with values between 2--10 W/m^2^ [@Smil:2015; @vanZalk:2018; @Miller:2019; @Nitsch:2019]. This can have different reasons: the capacity density depends on the placement of turbines in the wind park and it depends on the wind turbine. More importantly, because land is not the most important cost component of wind farm, they are not necessarily build in a way to maximise capacity density. In this study, I am using a capacity density estimate taken from [@vanZalk:2018] based on measurements in the US. Here, the authors found 8.8 W/m^2^ on average with a standard deviation of ~ 2 W/m^2^, see Table @tbl:overview-uncertain-parameters.

Uncertainty about land requirements of utility-scale PV is similarly high. Around 40%-50% of the area of solar farms is covered by modules [@Turney:2011; @Smil:2015; @Wirth:2017], while the rest of the land is used for inverters, power lines, spacing, and roads. In addition, the technology used, orientation, and efficiency of the PV modules have great impact on land use as well as they determine the capacity installable on the area covered by modules. Theoretically derived capacity densities using today's module efficiencies are in the range of 80--100 W/m^2^ [@Wirth:2017], but measurements from the US show much lower estimates of 20--30 W/m^2^ only [@Smil:2015; @vanZalk:2018; @Miller:2019]. A recent study from Germany shows, however, that the capacity density of German utility-scale PV has increased drastically over time: in less than 20 years, it increased by factor 3 to ~70 W/m^2^ in 2018 [@ZSW:2019]. The authors explain the trend not only by increasing module efficiencies, but also by more economic use of land. These findings show that theoretically derived capacity densities may actually be more accurate for future projections than historic measurements, and I am therefor using capacity densities derived from theory. I am assuming that land is covered to 40--50% by modules [@Turney:2011; @Smil:2015; @Wirth:2017], and that module efficiency is between 17.5--22% [@Wirth:2020],  see Table @tbl:overview-uncertain-parameters. Assuming a uniform distribution for both, this leads to an expected capacity density value of utility-scale PV of ~88 W/m^2^.

The remaining two supply technologies, rooftop PV and offshore wind, have no land use whatsoever. Rooftop PV is built on existing structures, and offshore wind is not built on land. This makes them promising options for reducing land use.

Hydroelectricity, bioenergy, storage, and transmission will all require land which I am not analysing in this study. The reasons for me to ignore land use of each of the components are the following: I ignore footprint of hydroelectricity, because system designs in this study contain the exact amount that is installed today. Hydroelectricity land use in all cases is the same, and it is equal to today's.

Land use of bioenergy is very small as long as only residuals are used for fuel production. When dedicated energy crops are farmed, bioenergy has the lowest capacity density of all renewable technologies [@vanZalk:2018]. The by far largest contribution to its land use stems from fields for crop farming, however. Because I allow only residuals to be used for electricity generation, land use equates to the footprint of power plants only, which is in the order of 10^4^ W/m^2^ [@Smil:2015] and thus 2--3 orders of magnitude larger than solar and wind power. This makes bioenergy's contribution to total system land use insignificant and I am therefore ignoring it in this study. 

Land use of battery storage is also very small. Commercial suppliers offer 1 MW systems in standard container enclosing today [^1], leading to a capacity density in the order of 10^5^ W/m^2^. A capacity density of this magnitude makes the land use of battery storage insignificant, even if spacing, roads and further infrastructure must be added. <mark>What about hydrogen?</mark>

Lastly, the transmission grid does today have a significant land use, which will likely increase in fully renewable systems. Currently, there are 480,000 km of AC transmission lines in the entso-e grid [@ENTSO-E:2019]. With an estimated 13.5 m buffer zone on each side [@Stevens:2017], this leads to 13,000 km^2^ (0.3%) of land required. A former study found that fully renewable electricity requires roughly a doubling of the transmission capacity when countries are net self-sufficient [@Trondle:inreview]. Considering power per line remains the same as it is today, their scenario would require 25,000 km^2^ (0.5%) of European land for transmission lines. Despite these numbers, I am not assessing the land use of transmission in this study. For computational reasons, spatial resolution is the national level which is too high to determine land use of transmission.

## Stochastic model

I use technology cost and technology land use parameters to derive total system cost and total land use of solar and wind in all 286 system designs stemming from the system design phase. I do this in two steps. First, I sample 100,000 times from the input uncertainties using Saltelli’s extension of the Sobol sequence [@Herman:2017] to derive a sufficiently large sample set of the seven dimensional input space. Second, for each sample and each system design I derive total land use of solar and wind by applying the inverse of capacity density to the installed capacity in the system design. Similarly, I derive total system cost by scaling technology cost of solar and wind from the system design with the factors given from the input sample. This leads to ~29 million observations of pairs of cost and land use, which I am using to analyse cost effectiveness of different supply technologies.

# Results

## Land use of cost-optimal fully renewable electricity

Cost minimal system layout has 30% utility scale PV and 70% onshore wind -- no rooftop PV and no offshore wind. Such a system requires ~120,000 km^2^ or 2.5% of European land (Figure @fig:map). This is equivalent to the size of Switzerland and Austria.

The blue area shows the amount of land equivalent to the one that is required for solar and wind installations. In addition to solar and wind, electricity is generated from hydropower capacity of today's magnitude and bioenergy capacity generating electricity from biomass residuals.](report/map.png){#fig:map .class}

## Rooftop PV is not Pareto optimal in solar-wind systems

A system with only rooftop PV capacities requires no land at all, but its cost are 180% of the minimal cost (Figure {@fig:ternary-land-use-roof}a). More balanced combinations of onshore wind, utility-scale PV, and rooftop PV lead to cost and land-use combinations within this range: from the minimal cost up to 180% of the minimal cost, and from no land use to an area equivalent to the area of Switzerland and Austria. Only systems with no or almost no solar electricity have a land use even higher than that (Figure {@fig:ternary-land-use}b).

System designs including rooftop PV are almost never Pareto optimal; they are Pareto optimal only if the system is not at all supplied by wind (Figure @fig:scatter-land-use-roof). The land use of the cost optimal case can be reduced Pareto-optimally by exchanging wind capacity with utility-scale PV capacity. The first 10% land-use reductions are almost cost-neutral, and 50% land-use reductions can be achieved with a cost penalty of about 15%. Generally, the relationship is progressive, meaning that every additional land-use reduction is more costly than the one before. On average, reducing land use by moving from wind to utility-scale PV increases cost by 0.7 EUR / m^2^ / yr. Reducing land use further, by moving from utility-scale PV to rooftop PV, increases cost by 4.6 EUR / m^2^ / yr.

Darker colours indicate the share of rooftop PV (top), utility-scale PV (middle), and onshore wind (bottom).](report/land-use/scatter-roof.svg){#fig:scatter-land-use-roof .class}

## Offshore wind is cost-effective

Because rooftop PV is not Pareto optimal in solar-wind systems, I remove it and consider offshore wind as the third technology option in the following. Offshore wind is not included in a cost-minimal system design, but by enforcing high shares, onshore land use can be reduced to 10% of the cost-minimal case (Figure {@fig:ternary-land-use}d). Land use cannot be completely removed, because some countries have no shores and thus, they satisfy their domestic electricity demand with onshore wind instead of offshore wind (see Methods). Consequently, the European offshore share is never above 84%. In system designs with utility-scale PV and onshore and offshore wind, total system cost is never above 130% of the cost-minimal case, and cost is driven mainly by high shares of utility-scale PV (Figure {@fig:ternary-land-use}c).

Pareto optimal system designs always contain moderate amounts of utility-scale PV, and varying shares of onshore and offshore wind, leading to systems with either low cost or low land use (Figure @fig:scatter-land-use-offshore). Moving along the Pareto frontier from the cost-minimal case with 70% onshore wind to the land-use-minimal case with 70% offshore wind increases cost by 0.2 EUR / m^2^ / yr. Here, the curve is not progressive, but almost linear. The land-use-minimal case requires only about 12% of the onshore land of the cost-minimal case.

![**Cost and land use of fully renewable electricity systems with different shares of offshore wind, utility-scale PV, and onshore wind.** All systems contain no rooftop PV capacity.

Darker colours indicate the share of offshore wind (top), utility-scale PV (middle), and onshore wind (bottom).](report/land-use/scatter-offshore.svg){#fig:scatter-land-use-offshore .class}

Onshore land use of fully renewable electricity systems can be most cost-effectively reduced using offshore wind. As long as offshore areas are not factored in, the cost is about 0.2 EUR / m^2^ / yr. The second most cost-effective option is utility-scale photovoltaics, which can reduce land use for about 0.7 EUR / m^2^ / yr. Rooftop PV, due to its high installation costs, is the least cost-effective option and requires up to 4.6 EUR / m^2^ / yr to reduce land use.

## Flexibility needs

Aside from different supply capacity, systems with different onshore land use require significantly different balancing capacity in terms of electricity storage, bioenergy, and transmission. Balancing needs are moderate for cases with balanced mixes of supply technologies (Figure @fig:flexibility). When supply is strongly biased towards one technology, flexibility needs rise, and in some cases they rise sharply. Exclusively-, or almost exclusively-solar cases require high amounts of short-term (battery) electricity storage. In the extreme case, storage capacities alone are able to fulfil the largest part of Europe's peak demand. Short-term storage capacities in these cases are combined with very high magnitudes of bioenergy capacity of up to 50% of peak demand to balance solar's seasonal fluctuations. Cases with mainly wind require much less bioenergy capacity and short-term storage capacity, but significantly more long-term storage capacities to balance wind fluctuations between days and weeks. In addition, they require around 2.5 times larger international transmission capacity than solar systems. While some of these numbers are very high, especially for cases with single supply technologies, there is no reason to believe these balancing capacities could not be built.

![**Flexibility needs for all analysed electricity system designs.** All designs are exclusively supplied from today's hydropower capacity and different shares of three additional technologies each: onshore wind and utility-scale PV in all cases, combined with either rooftop PV (top row) or offshore wind (bottom row). Each technology is varied from 0--100% of the total capacity of the three technologies. **a,b,c,d,** Storage power capacity (**a**), storage energy capacity (**b**), international transmission capacity (**c**), and bioenergy capacity (**d**). Not shown are hydropower capacities which are kept constant in all cases (36 GW run of river, 103 GW / 97 TWh reservoirs, 54 GW / 1.3 TWh pumped hydro storage).](report/flexibility.svg){#fig:flexibility .class}

Balancing technologies require land as well and thus add to the land use of the electricity system. Their land use is comparably small, however. [TODO Discuss land use of balancing using some number.]

## Uncertainty

Are the results robust towards uncertainties of technology cost and land use factors? I will perform a simple uncertainty analysis here. I will keep all system designs as they have been found, but I will vary the cost of supply technologies (and maybe balancing as well, but rather not) and their land use factors. This will allow me to show the impact of this uncertainty on the main results: 0.2 EUR / m^2^ / yr for offshore, 0.7 EUR / m^2^ / yr for utility-scale, and 4.6 EUR / m^2^ / yr for rooftop PV.

The approach is a simple approach, because the system design depends on the cost uncertainty. On the supply side, however, this relationship is not strong, because I enforce supply capacities. On the balancing side, this is more critical: reducing cost of bioenergy should lead to more bioenergy capacity, but using my approach, it won't. That's why I may not be able to analyse cost uncertainty of balancing technologies here.

I will, however, discuss the effect qualitatively. Also, I will discuss qualitatively the impact of electrifying the heat sector.
