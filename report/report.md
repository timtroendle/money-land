# Introduction

Europe has the potential to generate all its electricity from renewable sources [@EuropeanEnvironmentAgency:2009a; @McKenna:2015; @Jacobson:2017; @Ruiz:2019; @Trondle:2019; @Bodis:2019a; @IEA:2019; @Caglayan:2019]. The potential provides an avenue to largely or completely decarbonise the European electricity system, which is a necessary step to reach the European Commission's own goal of becoming a climate-neutral economy by 2050 [@EuropeanCommission:2018]. A transition to renewable electricity will likely increase the total land requirements of electricity supply however and, depending on which aspects are factored in, it may even do so by orders of magnitude.

The predominant forms of electricity supply based on fossil and nuclear fuels generally have small footprints [@MacKay:2008; @Smil:2015; @Stevens:2017; @vanZalk:2018]. Their hunger for land is even smaller in Europe considering that Europe imports the larger part of fossil and nuclear fuels [@PublicationsOfficeoftheEuropeanUnion:2017] and that mining for fuel contributes the most to the land requirements of this kind of electricity [@Smil:2015; @Stevens:2017]. Renewable electricity generally has higher land requirements [@MacKay:2008; @Smil:2015; @Stevens:2017; @vanZalk:2018] incurring entirely within Europe if electricity is not imported. It is thus likely that a transition to renewable sources increases the total amount of land impacted by the electricity system.

While renewable electricity is an indispensable instrument to mitigate climate change globally, its high land requirements have the potential to cause conflicts locally where it is built. This is for three reasons. First, it may compete with other uses of land. Of the main two current technologies of renewable electricity, photovoltaics and wind turbines, only the latter allows for limited dual use of land: for technical reasons, spacing between turbines is rather large and, as a result, spacing can be used for agriculture, but only for agriculture [@Smil:2015]. Second, generation infrastructure can negatively impact ecosystems. A review from 2017 [@Gasparatos:2017] concludes that not all relationships between solar and wind power and biodiversity are known yet, but that habitat losses and habitat changes are certainly among the negative ones. Third, renewable generation infrastructure has the potential to devaluate land on which it is built, and also neighbouring land. There is conflicting evidence whether wind power in sight of properties can impact property values, and while the majority of studies does not find statistically significant impacts, some others find losses in property values of up to 15% [@Brinkley:2019]. Wind [@Molnarova:2012] and solar power [@Sanchez-Pantoja:2018] are sometimes perceived as negatively impacting the landscape, depending on place attachment and the aesthetics of the previously undisturbed landscape [@Devine-Wright:2010; @Molnarova:2012; @deVries:2012], location and density of structures [@Molnarova:2012], but importantly also as a result of procedural aspects [@Zoellner:2008; @Hoen:2019].

Despite the negative impacts of renewable electricity and its high land requirements, acceptance of the energy transition is high and the majority of the population does not feel disturbed by wind and solar installations [@Knebel:2016; @Setton:2019]. Still, opposition towards local renewable electricity projects has hindered and postponed projects in the past [@Stokes:2016; @Spath:2018] (MORE SOURCES) and may continue to do so in the future, in particular considering the significant expansion of impacted land area moving towards fully decarbonised electricity supply. This led some authors to the conclusion that fully renewable electricity -- while being theoretically possible -- will not be feasible in Europe [@MacKay:2008; @Smil:2015].

There are strategies to mitigate negative impacts associated to the land requirements of renewable electricity. When proving effective, these strategies can not only reduce negative side-effects, but also increase the feasibility of electricity systems with large shares of renewable electricity. Most of the strategies fall into one of the following categories: location and placement of generation infrastructure [@Molnarova:2012; @Gasparatos:2017], decreasing density of generation infrastructure [@Gasparatos:2017; @Setton:2019], technological developments [@Gasparatos:2017], community involvement during project development phase [@Zoellner:2008; @Schroeter:2016; @Susser:2017], and lastly technology choice [@Palmer-Wilson:2019]. Due to the complex and partially conflicting dependency between negative effects, none of the strategies alone may be able to mitigate all negative impacts simultaneously. For example, decreasing the density of wind parks may be an effective measure to mitigate annoyance of residents [@Molnarova:2012; @Setton:2019]. Lower density wind parks have higher land requirements, however, and therefore increase conflicts with other land uses and increase impacts on ecosystems. A combination of several measures is therefore necessary to make a difference.

In this article, I explore the impact that supply technology choice can have on total land requirements of fully renewable electricity systems in Europe. Renewable supply technologies have vastly different land requirements, with two orders of magnitude between the land requirements of bioenergy, the technology with the largest footprint, and solar electricity, which has the lowest footprint [@Smil:2015; @vanZalk:2018]. Former research shows that fully renewable electricity supply in Europe is possible in many different ways, with very different shares of supply technologies, and that cost between different designs must not vary much [@Schlachtberger:2017; @Neumann:2019; @Trondle:inreview]. However, while several studies have assessed cost [@Bussar:2014; @Connolly:2016; @Plessmann:2017; @Jacobson:2017; @Brown:2018; @Child:2019] and land requirements [@Fthenakis:2009; @Jacobson:2017; @Trondle:2019] of supply technologies and entire electricity systems, only one study has assessed the relationship between the two on the system level [@Palmer-Wilson:2019]. The system perspective is central to renewable electricity systems as it takes into account not only the supply side but also technologies to handle fluctuations of the supply side. In their case study of Alberta, Canada, the authors find higher total system cost for lower thresholds of available land area even though they allow for significant amounts of electricity from non-renewable sources. No study has assessed the relationship between land requirements and cost on the system level using only renewable resources in Europe. I address the relationship in this study by determining cost-effective ways to reduce land requirements of fully renewable electricity systems in Europe through supply technology choice.

To find cost-effective ways to reduce land requirements, I do the following: I use a nationally resolved, dynamic, and cost-minimising model of the European electricity system to determine cost and land requirements of fully renewable supply. I analyse 286 distinct shares of four supply technologies: onshore and offshore wind, and utility-scale and rooftop PV. The optimisation model determines the cost-optimal total amount of supply and balancing technologies. Taking into account uncertainty in cost and land requirement parameters, I use the results of the 286 runs to identify the cost-effectiveness in reducing land requirements of the supply side.

# Data and methods

To be able to identify cost-effective ways to reduce land requirements by supply technology choice, I generate total system cost and total land requirement data for fully renewable electricity supply in Europe with different shares of supply technologies using a model-based approach. I generate the data in two steps. First, I generate cost-minimised system designs of fully renewable electricity in Europe. A system design consists of renewable supply capacity, capacities to balance renewable supply, and international transmission capacity. I derive system designs for 286 different combinations of shares of four renewable supply technologies: onshore wind, offshore wind, utility-scale PV, and rooftop PV. I may, for example, enforce a system with 40% rooftop PV and 60% onshore wind. For all technology cost inheriting uncertainty, I use expected values in the system design model. Second, I determine total system cost and land requirements for all 286 system designs. In this step, I am applying a stochastic model that considers uncertainty in cost and land requirement parameters of supply technologies. I use the Monte Carlo method to sample 100,000 times from the model and determine uncertainty in total system cost and land requirements for each system design. In total, I end up with ~29 million observations of pairs of cost and land requirements. All data procedures and all analysis steps are publicly available <mark>(after peer-review)</mark> as a Snakemake workflow [@Koster:2012].

I use the observations to show whether there is a trade-off between cost and land requirements and if yes, which technology choice options exist to reduce land requirements of fully renewable electricity systems. The following subsections explain all data generation and analysis steps in more detail.

## Capacity shares of supply technologies

To understand how supply technology choice can mitigate land requirements of renewable electricity in Europe, I enforce different capacity shares of technologies in the system designs that I am analysing. The geographic scope of this study includes all countries with member organisations in the entso-e, excluding Iceland, Cyprus, and Turkey: EU-27, the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Norway, and Western Balkan countries. I focus on four main supply technologies based on wind and solar: on- and offshore wind, utility-scale, ground-mounted photovoltaics (PV) and roof-mounted PV. I analyse all 286 possible combinations based on ten different shares per technology, from 0% through 10% and 20% up to 100%. The shares are valid on the European level, but also on the national level, meaning that each country in Europe has to maintain shares individually. Furthermore, I assume each country to be net self-sufficient, generating enough electricity annually to fulfil its domestic electricity demand.

Other than these four supply technologies, the system designs furthermore contain hydro electricity and bioenergy, both of which can generate renewable electricity to a limited extent as well. While I do not restrict their capacity shares, they are both restricted by their generation potential: hydro electricity is limited to current capacities, and bioenergy is limited to the amount of biofuels that can be generated from residuals (see System design model). Both contribute to electricity supply, but only to minor extents.

Each country in Europe can potentially generate enough electricity from rooftop PV, utility-scale PV, and onshore wind to cover national demand together with limited generation from hydroelectricity and bioenergy (see System design model). Thus, system designs with 100% rooftop PV, 100% utility-scale PV, or 100% onshore wind are possible. The situation is different for offshore wind: while the generation potential for all Europe is large enough to cover European demand, only countries with shores can build offshore wind farms. In countries without shore I replace offshore wind with onshore wind; i.e. when all countries with shores have to enforce a 40% capacity share of offshore wind, and a 20% capacity share of onshore wind, all countries without shores have to have a 60% capacity share of onshore wind. Countries without shores, or with insufficient offshore potentials are: Austria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Switzerland, Czech Republic, Hungary, Luxembourg, Macedonia, Serbia, Slovakia, and Slovenia.

Based on the enforced supply capacity shares, the system design model determines absolute installed capacities in each country for all supply technologies, but also for all storage and international transmission capacities.

## System design model

The system design model determines cost-minimal system designs for all Europe. The model is a network flow model with the electricity transmission grid at its core. Each country in Europe is modelled as a node on the network and all nodes are connected through the transmission grid. The model has a 4h resolution and simulates one full weather year to cover renewable fluctuations. It is a linear optimisation model that optimises system design and operation simultaneously. The model is implemented using the Calliope model framework [@Pfenninger:2018b] and has been used in a former publication. It is described in full detail in [@Trondle:inreview].

On the supply side, the model contains six renewable technologies to generate electricity: on- and offshore wind, utility-scale and rooftop PV, and hydroelectricity with and without reservoirs. Capacities are limited by their technical potentials, which I derive from [@Trondle:2019] for wind and solar power, and from [@Trondle:inreview] for hydroelectricity. For hydroelectricity, I assume no further expansion from today is possible, and thus its technical potential equates to today's capacity. For wind and solar power, I ignore today's capacities and allow any capacity up to their technical potential. Generation profiles are based on weather data [@Dee:2011; @Pfenninger:2016; @Staffell:2016] and taken from the same sources as the potentials. Based on the enforced supply capacity shares, the system design model determines cost-minimal capacities of supply technologies.

To balance fluctuating hydro, solar, and wind generation, system designs contain battery storage, hydrogen storage, pumped storage hydroelectricity, and bioenergy. All storage technologies are modelled as single storage tanks with efficiencies, i.e. there is no flow of energy in any other form than electricity. Battery storage is limited in a way that it can discharge for a maximum of four hours at full power, while hydrogen storage must be able to do the same for at least four hours. Bioenergy is limited by the amount of fuels that can be produced from residuals in each country per year [@RuizCastello:2015], i.e. I do not assume dedicated farming for energy crops. The limited fuel supply allows bioenergy to contribute only little to fulfilling electricity demand. Bioenergy and storage capacities other than pumped hydro are not restricted in any way. I assume pumped storage hydroelectricity can not be expanded significantly and it is thus limited to today's capacities [@Trondle:inreview]. The system design model determines cost-minimal capacities of all balancing technologies.

All supply, balancing, and international transmission capacities come with cost: overnight installation cost, annual maintenance cost, and variable cost (see @tbl:overview-cost-assumptions). The technology costs are important determinants of the magnitude of capacities chosen by the system design model. Their values are future projections and assume all technologies are deployed to large scale. Together with the technology lifetime, I determine annuities from these cost components. I uniformly assume cost of capital to be 7.3%, which has been the historic average [@Steffen:2019].

While future cost is uncertain, I am using expected values in the deterministic system design model. To cover the aspect that future cost is not know exactly, I handle cost uncertainties in the generation steps that follow the system design phase.

## Cost uncertainty

Cost of almost all components of future renewable electricity systems can be expected to fall compared to today. Cost falls with deployment as production processes get improved, product understanding increases with the use, and financing can be provided with lower overheads. Exactly how much cost will fall with deployment is not known, however. To cover this uncertainty, I am using minimum and maximum estimates of cost [@JRC:2014] of the four supply technologies analysed in this study. Because I do not have any other information about how likely any cost developments are, I am following the principle of maximum entropy and I am assuming a uniform distribution between minimum and maximum estimates in the following, see @tbl:overview-uncertain-parameters.

I only consider uncertainty in cost of on- and off-shore wind, and utility-scale and rooftop PV, first because these are the technologies whose cost-effectiveness I am assessing in this study. Second, I focus on these four, because I control their shares in the system design model in which I apply expected values of cost. Changes in their cost has little impact on system designs. Changes in cost of other technologies could lead to different designs, for example if hydrogen storage cost is much higher than the expected value, hydrogen may be replaced with bioenergy. For this reason, I am using expected values only (see @tbl:overview-cost-assumptions) for all other components other than the four wind and solar supply technologies.

## Land requirements

To determine the land requirements of supply technologies, I assume capacities of technologies always to require the same amount of land and therefore apply a proportional constant to installed capacities: the inverse of capacity density, given in square meters per Watt. As the range of capacity density values given in the literature is large for onshore wind and utility-scale PV, I am using a stochastic approach here as well.

The land requirement of onshore wind in this study is the footprint of wind turbines together with the technically necessary spacing between turbines. While the spacing can be used for agriculture, it excludes other land uses and the spacing also does not reduce land devaluation as discussed above. Thus, I include spacing in the land requirements of wind turbines in this study.

Theoretically, the capacity density of onshore wind can be high: based on technical specifications, it is up to 19\ W/m^2^ for the best turbines and ~10\ W/m^2^ on average [@McKenna:2015]. However, in deployed wind farms, the capacity density is much lower, with values between 2--10\ W/m^2^ [@Smil:2015; @vanZalk:2018; @Miller:2019; @Nitsch:2019]. This can have different reasons: the capacity density depends on the placement of turbines in the wind park and it depends on the technical specifications of the wind turbine. More importantly, because land is not the most important cost component of wind farms, farms are not necessarily build in a way to maximise capacity density. In this study, I am using a capacity density estimate taken from [@vanZalk:2018] based on measurements in the US. Here, the authors found 8.8\ W/m^2^ on average with a standard deviation of ~2\ W/m^2^, see @tbl:overview-uncertain-parameters.

Uncertainty about land requirements of utility-scale PV is similarly high. Around 40%--50% of the area of solar farms is covered by modules [@Turney:2011; @Smil:2015; @Wirth:2017], while the rest of the land is used for inverters, power lines, spacing, and roads. In addition, the technology used, orientation, and efficiency of the PV modules have great impact on land requirements as well as they determine the capacity installable on the area covered by modules. Theoretically derived capacity densities using today's module efficiencies are in the range of 80--100\ W/m^2^ [@Wirth:2017], but measurements from the US show much lower estimates of 20--30\ W/m^2^ only [@Smil:2015; @vanZalk:2018; @Miller:2019]. A recent study from Germany shows, however, that the capacity density of German utility-scale PV has increased drastically over time: in less than 20 years, it increased by factor 3 to ~70\ W/m^2^ in 2018 [@ZSW:2019]. The authors explain the trend not only by increasing module efficiencies, but also by more economic use of land. These findings show that theoretically derived capacity densities may actually be more accurate for future projections than historic measurements, and I am therefore using capacity densities derived from theory. I am assuming that land is covered to 40--50% by modules [@Turney:2011; @Smil:2015; @Wirth:2017], and that module efficiency is between 17.5--22% [@Wirth:2020], see @tbl:overview-uncertain-parameters. Assuming a uniform distribution for both, this leads to an expected capacity density value of utility-scale PV of ~88\ W/m^2^.

The remaining two supply technologies, rooftop PV and offshore wind, have no land requirements whatsoever. Rooftop PV is built on existing structures, and offshore wind is not built on land. This makes them promising options for reducing total land requirements of renewable electricity systems.

Hydroelectricity, bioenergy, storage, and transmission will all require land which I am not analysing in detail in this study. The reasons for me to ignore land requirements of each of the components are the following: First, I do not analyse footprints of hydroelectricity in detail, because system designs in this study all contain the exact amount that is installed today. Thus, hydroelectricity's land requirements in all cases is the same, and it is equal to today's. Today's footprint is not insignificant, however. It is dominated by the extent of its water reservoirs [@Smil:2015], which span roughly 50,000\ km^2^ (1% of total land) in Europe [@Halleraker:2016]. Not all of the reservoirs in Europe are used for electricity generation, and even less are used exclusively for it [@Halleraker:2016], so this total number can be seen as an upper bound of the land requirements of hydroelectricity.

Second, land requirements of bioenergy are very small as long as only residuals are used for fuel production. When dedicated energy crops are farmed, bioenergy has the lowest capacity density of all renewable technologies [@vanZalk:2018]. The by far largest contribution to its land requirements stems from fields for crop farming, however. Because I allow only residuals to be used for electricity generation, land requirements equate to the footprint of power plants only, which leads to a capacity density in the order of 10^4^\ W/m^2^ [@Smil:2015] and thus 2--3 orders of magnitude larger than solar and wind power. This makes bioenergy's contribution to total system land requirements insignificant and I am therefore ignoring it in this study.

Third, land requirements of electricity storage depend on the amount of electricity that must be stored. Commercial suppliers offer 1 MW / 1 MWh battery storage systems in standardised container enclosings today [^1], leading to a capacity density in the order of 10^5^\ W/m^2^ and 10^5^\ Wh/m^2^. Power-wise, a capacity density of this magnitude makes the land requirements of battery storage insignificant compared to the one of solar and wind power, even if spacing, roads and further infrastructure must be added. Energy-wise, capacity density cannot be compared to solar and wind power, and the total land requirements depend on the amount of electricity that must be stored in batteries. This is equally true for hydrogen storage. Here, the energy-wise capacity density depends on how hydrogen is stored. Hydrogen has a low energy density of 3\ kWh/m^3^ if stored uncompressed at normal conditions. It can be stored underground in salt caverns, or overground in steel tanks. Capacity density is lowest if hydrogen is stored in such overground tanks in uncompressed form. Together with a conservative height of the tanks of 2\ meters, this equals 6,000\ Wh/m^2^. This conservative estimation is worse than the one for battery storage. Because much more electricity is anticipated to be stored as hydrogen rather than in batteries, total land requirements of hydrogen storage may be high, if it is not stored in compressed forms, in tanks taller than 2\ meters, or underground, and if large amounts must be stored. The latter is not the case for the system designs I am considering in this study (see "Storage and flexible generation require insignificant amounts of land" in results section), and thus I am ignoring the insignificant land requirements of battery storage and hydrogen storage.

Lastly, the transmission grid already today has significant land requirements, which will likely increase in fully renewable systems. Currently, there are 480,000\ km of AC transmission lines in the entso-e grid [@ENTSO-E:2019]. With an estimated 13.5\ m buffer zone on each side [@Stevens:2017], this leads to 13,000\ km^2^ (0.3%) of land required. A former study found that fully renewable electricity requires roughly a doubling of the transmission capacity when countries are net self-sufficient [@Trondle:inreview], as they are in this study. Considering power per line remains the same as it is today, their scenario would require 25,000\ km^2^ (0.5%) of European land for transmission lines. Despite these numbers, I am not assessing the land requirements of transmission in this study. The spatial resolution of this study, the national level, is too high to determine necessary land for transmission.

## Stochastic model

I use technology cost and technology land requirement parameters to derive total system cost and total land requirements of solar and wind power in all 286 system designs stemming from the system design phase. I do this in two steps. First, I sample 100,000 times from the input uncertainties using Saltelli’s extension of the Sobol sequence [@Herman:2017] to derive a sufficiently large sample set of the seven dimensional input space. Second, for each sample and each system design I derive total land requirements of solar and wind power by applying the inverse of capacity density to the installed capacity in the system design. Similarly, I derive total system cost by scaling technology cost of solar and wind from the system design with the factors given from the input sample. This leads to ~29 million observations of pairs of cost and land requirements, which I am using to analyse cost effectiveness of different supply technologies.

# Results

## Renewable electricity supply with vastly different land requirements

Among all ~29 million observations, cost of electricity in all Europe is between 0.06 and 0.11\ EUR per kWh consumed while land requirements of solar and wind power are between 0% and 3% of total European land mass (see @fig:observations). These ranges include all possible cases of supply share combinations, including systems supplied, next to hydroelectricity and bioenergy, exclusively from onshore wind, utility-scale PV, and rooftop PV, or with high shares of offshore wind. The ranges furthermore contain technology cost and technology land requirement parameters from the full range of their uncertainty. The observations show that European electricity systems with vastly different land requirements are possible, while their cost never exceeds twice the lowest cost.

Among all 286 system designs with different supply shares, a system with only onshore wind and utility-scale PV has the lowest expected cost of around 0.07\ EUR per kWh consumed and requires 2% of Europe's total land mass (~97,000\ km^2^) -- an area roughly the size of Portugal. Cost is minimal when both technologies contribute 50% to the total capacity of wind and solar technologies. While higher shares of utility-scale PV decrease land requirements, they also increase cost (see right flanks in {@fig:ternary}a,b). Higher shares of onshore wind increase both, cost and land requirements. A system design with only onshore wind has the highest expected land requirements (see top corner of {@fig:ternary}b). Rooftop PV has the largest potential to decrease land requirements, as it requires no additional land, but it also increases cost the most (see left corners of {@fig:ternary}a,b).

Electricity system designs with offshore wind in addition to onshore wind and utility-scale PV have significantly lower cost when they do not include rooftop PV (see {@fig:ternary}c). The potential of offshore wind to decrease land requirements is smaller than the one of rooftop PV, but only slightly (see {@fig:ternary}d). While offshore wind requires no additional land -- similar to rooftop PV -- it is not available in every country in Europe and is replaced by onshore wind in these places. Compared to onshore wind, the land requirements of all other three supply technologies -- offshore wind, utility-scale PV, and rooftop PV -- are significantly lower and thus, system designs with large shares of any of these alternatives have significantly smaller total land requirements, albeit at higher cost. There is a trade-off between expected land requirements of renewable electricity and its expected cost.

## Offshore wind reduces land requirements most cost-effectively

The rather large expected land requirements of the cost-minimal case can be reduced most cost-effectively by replacing onshore wind with offshore wind. In this way, total land requirements of renewable electricity can be reduced 85% for a cost penalty of 10% (see {@fig:technology}a). To reduce land needs even further, utility-scale PV has to be phased-out, leading to a sharp increase of cost (see two left-most points in {@fig:technology}a). On average, reducing land requirements as much as possible with only offshore wind costs in expectation 0.34\ EUR per m^2^ and year. However, cost increase sharply for the last minor reductions in land, for which utility-scale PV must be phased out. Prior to that, land reductions are less costly.

![**Cost-effective ways to reduce expected land requirements using supply technologies individually.** All panels show expected cost and expected land requirements of all 286 system designs in light blue in the background. **a,b,c,** Dark blue cases show Pareto-optimal decreases of land requirements from cost-minimal case using offshore wind only (**a**), utility-scale PV only (**b**), and rooftop PV only (**c**).](report/land-use/technology.svg){#fig:technology .class}

Reducing land requirements with utility-scale and rooftop PV has higher cost. The share of utility-scale PV can be expected to be increased on average for 0.63\ EUR per m^2^ and year (see {@fig:technology}b) by phasing out onshore wind. Cost is progressive however, and early increases have very low cost. In total, 80% of the cost-minimal land requirements can be removed with a cost penalty of 23%. The highest expected cost comes with phasing-in rooftop PV. Here, reducing land requirements by one square meter compared to the cost-minimal case requires 1.66 EUR per year on average (see {@fig:technology}c). Similar to utility-scale PV, the cost increases with higher rooftop shares and the largest increase can be explained by the technology that is phased-out: the first half of rooftop PV replaces onshore wind, while the second half replaces utility-scale PV at a much higher cost. The increase of offshore wind, utility-scale PV, and rooftop PV shares always reduces expected land requirements of fully renewable electricity systems, albeit at different cost.

## Low land requirements require low shares of onshore wind

While land needs of supply technologies are uncertain, onshore wind is in any case the technology with the highest requirements for land. Offshore wind, utility-scale PV, and rooftop PV are therefore secure no-regret options to reduce the spatial extent of renewable electricity generation on land. The uncertainty is a problem when it comes to finding cost-effective ways to limit the amount of land necessary, however. For example, Europe may decide to dedicate less than the expected, cost-minimal 2% of its land to electricity generation and instead accept a cost penalty and exchange onshore wind to another technology. One option is to increase the share of utility-scale PV from cost-minimal 50% to 60% or higher, which will securely lead to a reduction in land requirements. However, it may turn out that the cost penalty would not have been necessary. While the expected land requirements are 2% in the cost-minimal system design, in more than half of the cases it is less than that (see first column in  @fig:wind). In a quarter of the cases, requirements are below 1.6% -- and thus significantly lower than the expected value. A better understanding of how much land renewable supply technologies actually need is essential to reaching land area limits, and to reaching them cost-effectively.

![**Land requirements of electricity systems based on onshore wind and utility-scale PV.** Uncertainty stems from the uncertainty of how much land onshore wind, but also utility-scale PV requires. The uncertainty distribution of capacity shares is displayed using letter-value plots. Letter-value plots are an extension to boxplots for large data. Dark grey lines indicate the median value of the cost penalties, and the largest boxes above and below the median visualise the 25--75% quantiles. Each following box contains half as many observations as the box closer to the median. The extreme 1% of the observations are considered outliers and marked with rhombs.](report/land-use/wind.png){#fig:wind .class}

## Cost penalties of 20% or less are most likely even for low land requirements

Partly because of this uncertainty, it is uncertain whether the cost-minimal land requirements will be 2%. First, it is possible that onshore wind or utility-scale PV will require more land than expected, in which case the total land requirements will be higher than 2% (see @fig:wind). Second, as technology cost is uncertain as well, it is also possible that a system with more onshore wind than expected is cost-minimal. Such a system would again require more land. Both effects lead to the necessity of a cost penalty in a quarter of the cases when aiming at limiting total land impacted by renewable electricity to 2% (see @fig:land-threshold) -- albeit at a low magnitude. With lower thresholds on available land, cost penalties become more likely and their magnitudes rise. For example, to limit available land to 0.5%, a cost penalty is necessary in more than 75% of the cases and they may increase cost of renewable electricity by 50% or more. While the uncertainty ranges are large, electricity systems with low land requirements are likely possible without substantial cost penalties. When land requirements are reduced using offshore wind or utility-scale PV, cost penalties of 20% or less are most likely, even if the resulting electricity system spans less than 0.5% of European land.

The uncertainty does not alter the order of cost-effectiveness of the three supply technologies with low land requirements: rooftop PV can be expected to always be the least cost-effective technology. Offshore wind is most cost-effective, but only when large amounts of onshore wind are replaced by it (see land area thresholds of 1% or smaller in @fig:land-threshold). In these cases, offshore wind is more cost-effective than utility-scale PV. For medium amounts of onshore wind replacements, expected value of cost and its distribution are nearly the same for both technologies. Below that, as long as land area is to be reduced only little, utility-scale PV is the most cost-effective option.

## Storage and flexible generation require insignificant amounts of land

Systems with different shares of solar and wind capacity require significantly different balancing capacity in terms of electricity storage, bioenergy, and transmission. Balancing needs are moderate for cases with balanced mixes of supply technologies (@fig:flexibility). When supply is strongly biased towards one technology, flexibility needs rise, and in some cases they rise sharply. Exclusively-, or almost exclusively-solar cases require high amounts of short-term (battery) electricity storage. In the extreme case, storage capacities alone are able to fulfil the largest part of Europe's peak demand. Short-term storage capacities in these cases are combined with very high magnitudes of bioenergy capacity of up to 50% of peak demand to balance solar's seasonal fluctuations. Cases with mainly wind require much less bioenergy capacity and short-term storage capacity, but significantly more long-term storage capacities to balance wind fluctuations between days and weeks. In addition, they require around 2.5 times larger international transmission capacity than solar systems. While some of these numbers are very high, especially for cases with single supply technologies, there is no reason to believe these balancing capacities could not be built.

![**Flexibility needs of fully renewable electricity systems with all possible shares of three different supply technologies.** All designs are exclusively supplied from hydroelectricity of today's capacity and different shares of three additional technologies each: onshore wind and utility-scale PV in all cases, combined with either rooftop PV (top row) or offshore wind (bottom row). Each technology is varied from 0--100% of the total capacity of the three technologies. **a,b,c,d,** Storage power capacity (**a**), storage energy capacity (**b**), international transmission capacity (**c**), and bioenergy capacity (**d**).

Balancing capacities require land as well and thus add to the land requirements of the entire electricity system. The transmission grid will likely require a significant amount of land. In its current state, it uses an estimated 0.3% of total land, which could likely double, or increase even more for fully renewable electricity (see Methods). For the system designs in this study, I can only speculate about the land requirements of the transmission grid, as the spatial resolution is too low to generate estimations. If I take international transmission capacity as a proxy for land requirements of the transmission grid, wind dominated systems may require the largest amount of land for transmission (see {@fig:flexibility}c). Systems with very low shares of wind, however, also need comparably high amounts of international transmission capacity, and thus moderate amounts of wind and solar may require the smallest amount of land for their transmission system. Large shares of offshore wind will likely require more domestic transmission lines than equally high shares of onshore wind, as the electricity must be transported from the shores to demand centres in the former case. To validate these speculative relationships between system designs and land requirements of the transmission grid, a study with higher spatial resolution will need to be conducted.

The land requirements of all other balancing technologies are very small, however. When considering 10^5^\ Wh/m^2^ for battery storage capacity, a conservative 6,000\ Wh/m^2^ for hydrogen storage capacity, and 10^4^\ W/m^2^ for bioenergy capacity (see Methods), total land requirements of all three flexibility technologies are always below 1,800\ km^2^ (0.04% of total European land). Within this estimate, the by far largest contribution comes from hydrogen, which I assume to be stored uncompressed in overground tanks. If hydrogen is stored land efficiently in underground caverns, flexibility needs of all three technologies can rise by orders of magnitude without making a significant contribution to total land requirements of fully renewable electricity systems.

# Discussion and conclusion

I show that fully renewable electricity in Europe is possible with vastly different amounts of land required for solar and wind power, and that low land requirements do not necessarily require substantial cost penalties. The expected land requirements of a system design with minimal expected cost is 97,000\ km^2^ (2% total European land mass). Such a low-cost system is supplied, next to hydroelectricity and bioenergy from residuals, only from onshore wind farms and utility-scale photovoltaics (PV). Its expected land requirements can be reduced by increasing the share of utility-scale PV, or by phasing-in offshore wind or rooftop PV. Offshore wind is the most cost-effective option of these three possibilities. It can decrease the expected land requirements by 85% for an expected cost penalty of less than 10%. Higher than cost-optimal shares of utility-scale PV also can decrease expected land requirements up to 80%, with a cost penalty that rises progressively to 23%. Rooftop PV has the highest potential to decrease land requirements, but is least cost-effective.

Because cost and land requirements of wind and solar power are not known with certainty, total system cost and total land requirements of renewable electricity supply in Europe is uncertain as well. While the expected cost-minimal land requirements are 2% of total European land mass, a system with the same amount of land dedicated to solar and wind power may as well require a cost penalty. A cost penalty is required when higher than cost-minimal shares of offshore wind, utility-scale PV, or rooftop PV must be deployed to reduce land requirements. Ensuring land requirements stay below 2%, for example, requires a cost penalty in a third of the cases -- depending on how much solar and wind actually cost, and how much space they need. Cost penalties for lower targets can, in extreme cases, reach 50% of minimal system cost or more. Despite these uncertainties, three main findings are robust: First, onshore wind always requires the most amount of land and thus a switch to any other technology to reduce land is a no-regret option. Second, offshore wind is always the most cost-effective option, followed by utility-scale PV, and rooftop PV. Third, low land requirements of fully renewable electricity in Europe does likely not come with high cost: cost penalties of 20% or less are most likely for a system with low land requirements of 0.5% of European land mass through sufficient shares of offshore wind and utility-scale PV.

Considering all uncertainty and all possible system designs, land requirements of solar and wind power are in the range of 0--3% of total European land mass. Significant contributions to the land needs of electricity supply can be expected from the transmission grid and hydroelectricity (~0.5% and <1%, see Methods). The total land requirements of fully renewable electricity is thus likely within the range of 1.5--4.5%.

The high level perspective on land requirements in this study allows to understand the full spatial extent of electricity supply infrastructure on European land and its trade-off with cost. Land requirements of the different technologies, however, are not always directly comparable. For example, while solar photovoltaics does not allow for any other land use -- at least not as long as agrophotovoltaics is available in large scales [@Weselek:2019] -- the vast spacing between wind turbines does allow for agriculture. Thus, the two technologies compete differently with other uses of land. Offshore wind does of course require no land, but competes with other uses of offshore areas. Similarly, all supply technologies impact ecosystems in divergent and sometimes distinct ways [@Gasparatos:2017] and thus their impact is not directly comparable. Lastly, the potential to devaluate land and landscapes is perceived differently for different technologies. For example, onshore wind farms are perceived more negatively than utility-scale PV [@Setton:2019]. Because I analyse total land requirements in this study, I cannot account for these qualitative differences. However, I mitigate this limitation by making options to reduce land requirements technology-specific.

My findings show that supply technology choice is an effective way to reduce land requirements of fully renewable electricity systems in Europe. Systems with vastly different land requirements can be designed, and their cost must not vary much as long as land requirements are reduced cost-effectively. These findings increase the solution space for a European energy transition and allow to integrate more diverse stakeholder positions than was possible with traditional cost minimised electricity system designs. The different stakeholder positions must, however, not only be considered in the design of future renewable electricity systems: while the measures discussed in this study have a local impact on land requirements, their impact on cost may not be local -- it may be larger than that, and may even be continental. This aspect should be considered in the design of future electricity markets to achieve socially accepted renewable electricity with just distribution of cost.
