![**Cost and land use of fully renewable electricity systems with different shares of rooftop PV, utility-scale PV, and onshore wind.** Cost is relative to minimal cost. Land use is relative to land use of the minimal-cost case. **a,** Cost and land use of all cases. The red line indicates the Pareto frontier on which neither cost nor land use can be reduced without increasing the respective other. **b,** Cost and land use of all cases. Darker colours indicate the share of rooftop PV (top), utility-scale PV (middle), and onshore wind (bottom).](report/scatter.svg){#fig:scatter .class}
