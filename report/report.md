![**Cost and land use of fully renewable electricity systems with different shares of rooftop PV, utility-scale PV, and onshore wind.** All systems contain no offshore wind capacity. Cost is relative to minimal cost. Land use is relative to land use of the minimal-cost case. **a,** Cost and land use of all cases. The red line indicates the Pareto frontier on which neither cost nor land use can be reduced without increasing the respective other. **b,** Cost and land use of all cases.
