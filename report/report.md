# Introduction

Europe has the potential to generate all its electricity from renewable sources [@EuropeanEnvironmentAgency:2009a; @McKenna:2015; @Jacobson:2017; @Ruiz:2019; @Trondle:2019; @Bodis:2019a; @IEA:2019; @Caglayan:2019]. The potential provides an avenue to largely or completely decarbonise the European electricity system, which is a necessary step to reach the European Commission's own goal of becoming a climate-neutral economy by 2050 [@EuropeanCommission:2018]. A transition to renewable electricity will likely increase the total land use of electricity supply however and, depending on which aspects are factored in, it may even do so by orders of magnitude. 

The predominant forms of electricity supply based on fossil and nuclear fuels generally have small footprints [@MacKay:2008; @Smil:2015; @Stevens:2017; @vanZalk:2018]. Their hunger for land is even smaller in Europe considering that Europe imports the larger part of fossil and nuclear fuels [@PublicationsOfficeoftheEuropeanUnion:2017] and that mining for fuel contributes the most to the land use of this kind of electricity [@Smil:2015; @Stevens:2017]. Renewable electricity generally has a higher land use [@MacKay:2008; @Smil:2015; @Stevens:2017; @vanZalk:2018] incurring entirely within Europe if electricity is not imported. It is thus likely that a transition to renewable source increases the total amount of land that is impacted by the electricity system.

While renewable electricity is an indispensable means to mitigate climate change globally, its high land requirements has the potential to cause conflicts locally where it is built. This is for three reasons. First, it may compete with other land uses. Of the main two current technologies of renewable electricity, photovoltaics and wind turbines, only the latter allows for limited dual use of land: for technical reasons, spacing between turbines is rather large and, as a result, spacing can be used for agriculture, but only for agriculture [@Smil:2015]. Second, generation infrastructure can negatively impact ecosystems. A review from 2017 [@Gasparatos:2017] concludes that not all relationships between solar and wind power and biodiversity are known yet, but that habitat losses and habitat changes are certainly among the negative ones. Third, renewable generation infrastructure has the potential to devaluate land on which it is built, and also neighbouring land. There is conflicting evidence whether wind power in sight of properties can impact property values, and while the majority of studies does not find statistically significant impacts, some others find losses in property values of up to 15% [@Brinkley:2019]. Wind [@Molnarova:2012] and solar power [@Sanchez-Pantoja:2018] can be perceived as negatively impacting the landscape, depending on place attachment and the aesthetics of the previously undisturbed landscape [@Devine-Wright:2010; @Molnarova:2012; @deVries:2012], location and density of structures [@Molnarova:2012], but importantly also procedural aspects [@Zoellner:2008; @Hoen:2019]. 

Despite the negative impacts of renewable electricity and its high land use, acceptance of the energy transition is high and the majority of the population does not feel disturbed by wind and solar installations [@Knebel:2016; @Setton:2019]. Still, opposition towards local renewable electricity projects has hindered and postponed projects in the past [@Stokes:2016; @Spath:2018] (MORE SOURCES) and may continue to do so in the future, in particular considering the significant expansion of land use moving towards fully decarbonised electricity supply. This led some authors to the conclusion that fully renewable electricity -- while being theoretically possible -- will not be feasible in Europe [@MacKay:2008; @Smil:2015].

There are strategies to mitigate negative impacts associated to the land use of renewable electricity. When proving effective, these strategies can not only reduce negative side-effects, but also increase the feasibility of electricity systems with large shares of renewable electricity. Most of the strategies fall into one of the following categories: location and placement of generation infrastructure [@Molnarova:2012; @Gasparatos:2017], decreasing density of generation infrastructure [@Gasparatos:2017; @Setton:2019], technological developments [@Gasparatos:2017], community involvement during project development phase [@Zoellner:2008; @Schroeter:2016; @Susser:2017], and lastly technology choice [@Palmer-Wilson:2019]. Due to the partially complex and conflicting dependency between different negative effects, none of the strategies may alone be able to mitigate all negative impacts simultaneously. For example, decreasing the density of wind parks may be an effective measure to mitigate annoyance of residents [@Molnarova:2012; @Setton:2019]. Lower density wind parks have a higher land use, however, and therefore increase conflicts with other land use and increase impacts on ecosystems. A combination of several measures is therefore necessary to make a difference.

In this article, I explore the impact that supply technology choice can have on total land use of fully renewable electricity systems in Europe. Renewable supply technologies have vastly different land requirements, with two orders of magnitude between the land requirements of bioenergy, the technology with the largest footprint, and solar electricity, which has the lowest footprint [@Smil:2015; @vanZalk:2018]. Former research shows that fully renewable electricity supply in Europe is possible in many different ways, with very different shares of supply technologies, and that cost between different designs must not vary much [@Schlachtberger:2017; @Neumann:2019; @Trondle:inreview]. However, while several studies have assessed cost [@Bussar:2014; @Connolly:2016; @Plessmann:2017; @Jacobson:2017; @Brown:2018; @Child:2019] and land use [@Fthenakis:2009; @Jacobson:2017; @Trondle:2019] of supply technologies and entire electricity systems, only one study has assessed the relationship between the two on the system level [@Palmer-Wilson:2019]. The system perspective is central to renewable electricity systems as it takes into account not only the supply side but also technologies to balance renewable fluctuations. In their case study of Alberta, Canada, the authors find higher total system cost for lower land uses even though they allow for significant amounts of electricity from non-renewable sources. No study has assessed the relationship between land use and cost on the system level using only renewable resources in Europe. I address the relationship in this study by determining cost-effective ways to reduce land use of renewable supply infrastructure in fully renewable electricity systems in Europe.

To find cost-effective ways to reduce land use, I do the following. I use a nationally resolved, dynamic, and cost-minimising model of the European electricity system to determine cost and land use of fully renewable supply. I analyse 286 distinct shares of four supply technologies: onshore and offshore wind, and utility-scale and rooftop PV. The optimisation model determines the cost-optimal total amount of supply and balancing technologies. Taking into account uncertainty in cost and land use parameters, I use the results of the 286 runs to identify the cost-effectiveness in reducing land use of the supply technologies.

# Data and methods

I use the cost-minimising linear programming model introduced in ref [@Trondle:inreview]. I use a national spatial, and a 4h temporal resolution. I enforce national self-sufficiency, meaning that each country has to generate enough electricity to fulfil annual, domestic electricity demand.

Within this base model, for each considered case I enforce shares for four different supply technologies: onshore wind, offshore wind, utility-scale PV, and rooftop PV. I enforce relative installed capacity only, not the total amount of installed capacity. Because balancing losses are different in different cases, and because hydropower and biomass can supply electricity as well, the total installed capacity of wind and solar varies between the cases. For each case, the cost optimisation determines the cost-minimal total installed capacity of wind and solar, and the cost-minimal balancing capacities in each country. Balancing capacities comprise short-term storage (battery), long-term storage (hydrogen), bioenergy, and transmission.

I consider the land use factors as defined in ref [@Trondle:inreview] to determine land use based on installed capacity:

* onshore wind: 1 / 8 km^2^ / MW
* utility-scale PV: 1 / 80 km^2^ / MW
* offshore wind: 0 km^2^ / MW
* rooftop PV: 0 km^2^ / MW

# Results

## Land use of cost-optimal fully renewable electricity

Cost minimal system layout has 30% utility scale PV and 70% onshore wind -- no rooftop PV and no offshore wind. Such a system requires ~120,000 km^2^ or 2.5% of European land (Figure @fig:map). This is equivalent to the size of Switzerland and Austria.

The blue area shows the amount of land equivalent to the one that is required for solar and wind installations. In addition to solar and wind, electricity is generated from hydropower capacity of today's magnitude and bioenergy capacity generating electricity from biomass residuals.](report/map.png){#fig:map .class}

## Rooftop PV is not Pareto optimal in solar-wind systems

A system with only rooftop PV capacities requires no land at all, but its cost are 180% of the minimal cost (Figure {@fig:ternary-land-use-roof}a). More balanced combinations of onshore wind, utility-scale PV, and rooftop PV lead to cost and land-use combinations within this range: from the minimal cost up to 180% of the minimal cost, and from no land use to an area equivalent to the area of Switzerland and Austria. Only systems with no or almost no solar electricity have a land use even higher than that (Figure {@fig:ternary-land-use}b).

System designs including rooftop PV are almost never Pareto optimal; they are Pareto optimal only if the system is not at all supplied by wind (Figure @fig:scatter-land-use-roof). The land use of the cost optimal case can be reduced Pareto-optimally by exchanging wind capacity with utility-scale PV capacity. The first 10% land-use reductions are almost cost-neutral, and 50% land-use reductions can be achieved with a cost penalty of about 15%. Generally, the relationship is progressive, meaning that every additional land-use reduction is more costly than the one before. On average, reducing land use by moving from wind to utility-scale PV increases cost by 0.7 EUR / m^2^ / yr. Reducing land use further, by moving from utility-scale PV to rooftop PV, increases cost by 4.6 EUR / m^2^ / yr.

## Offshore wind is cost-effective

Because rooftop PV is not Pareto optimal in solar-wind systems, I remove it and consider offshore wind as the third technology option in the following. Offshore wind is not included in a cost-minimal system design, but by enforcing high shares, onshore land use can be reduced to 10% of the cost-minimal case (Figure {@fig:ternary-land-use}d). Land use cannot be completely removed, because some countries have no shores and thus, they satisfy their domestic electricity demand with onshore wind instead of offshore wind (see Methods). Consequently, the European offshore share is never above 84%. In system designs with utility-scale PV and onshore and offshore wind, total system cost is never above 130% of the cost-minimal case, and cost is driven mainly by high shares of utility-scale PV (Figure {@fig:ternary-land-use}c).

Pareto optimal system designs always contain moderate amounts of utility-scale PV, and varying shares of onshore and offshore wind, leading to systems with either low cost or low land use (Figure @fig:scatter-land-use-offshore). Moving along the Pareto frontier from the cost-minimal case with 70% onshore wind to the land-use-minimal case with 70% offshore wind increases cost by 0.2 EUR / m^2^ / yr. Here, the curve is not progressive, but almost linear. The land-use-minimal case requires only about 12% of the onshore land of the cost-minimal case.

![**Cost and land use of fully renewable electricity systems with different shares of offshore wind, utility-scale PV, and onshore wind.** All systems contain no rooftop PV capacity. Cost is relative to minimal cost. Land use is relative to land use of the minimal-cost case. **a,** Cost and land use of all cases. The red line indicates the Pareto frontier on which neither cost nor land use can be reduced without increasing the respective other. **b,** Cost and land use of all cases. Darker colours indicate the share of offshore wind (top), utility-scale PV (middle), and onshore wind (bottom).](report/land-use/scatter-offshore.svg){#fig:scatter-land-use-offshore .class}

Onshore land use of fully renewable electricity systems can be most cost-effectively reduced using offshore wind. As long as offshore areas are not factored in, the cost is about 0.2 EUR / m^2^ / yr. The second most cost-effective option is utility-scale photovoltaics, which can reduce land use for about 0.7 EUR / m^2^ / yr. Rooftop PV, due to its high installation costs, is the least cost-effective option and requires up to 4.6 EUR / m^2^ / yr to reduce land use.

## Flexibility needs

Aside from different supply capacity, systems with different onshore land use require significantly different balancing capacity in terms of electricity storage, bioenergy, and transmission. Balancing needs are moderate for cases with balanced mixes of supply technologies (Figure @fig:flexibility). When supply is strongly biased towards one technology, flexibility needs rise, and in some cases they rise sharply. Exclusively-, or almost exclusively-solar cases require high amounts of short-term (battery) electricity storage. In the extreme case, storage capacities alone are able to fulfil the largest part of Europe's peak demand. Short-term storage capacities in these cases are combined with very high magnitudes of bioenergy capacity of up to 50% of peak demand to balance solar's seasonal fluctuations. Cases with mainly wind require much less bioenergy capacity and short-term storage capacity, but significantly more long-term storage capacities to balance wind fluctuations between days and weeks. In addition, they require around 2.5 times larger international transmission capacity than solar systems. While some of these numbers are very high, especially for cases with single supply technologies, there is no reason to believe these balancing capacities could not be built.

![**Flexibility needs for all analysed electricity system designs.** All designs are exclusively supplied from today's hydropower capacity and different shares of three additional technologies each: onshore wind and utility-scale PV in all cases, combined with either rooftop PV (top row) or offshore wind (bottom row). Each technology is varied from 0--100% of the total capacity of the three technologies. **a,b,c,d,** Storage power capacity (**a**), storage energy capacity (**b**), international transmission capacity (**c**), and bioenergy capacity (**d**). Not shown are hydropower capacities which are kept constant in all cases (36 GW run of river, 103 GW / 97 TWh reservoirs, 54 GW / 1.3 TWh pumped hydro storage).](report/flexibility.svg){#fig:flexibility .class}

Balancing technologies require land as well and thus add to the land use of the electricity system. Their land use is comparably small, however. [TODO Discuss land use of balancing using some number.]

## Uncertainty

Are the results robust towards uncertainties of technology cost and land use factors? I will perform a simple uncertainty analysis here. I will keep all system designs as they have been found, but I will vary the cost of supply technologies (and maybe balancing as well, but rather not) and their land use factors. This will allow me to show the impact of this uncertainty on the main results: 0.2 EUR / m^2^ / yr for offshore, 0.7 EUR / m^2^ / yr for utility-scale, and 4.6 EUR / m^2^ / yr for rooftop PV.

The approach is a simple approach, because the system design depends on the cost uncertainty. On the supply side, however, this relationship is not strong, because I enforce supply capacities. On the balancing side, this is more critical: reducing cost of bioenergy should lead to more bioenergy capacity, but using my approach, it won't. That's why I may not be able to analyse cost uncertainty of balancing technologies here.

I will, however, discuss the effect qualitatively. Also, I will discuss qualitatively the impact of electrifying the heat sector.
