    Renewable electricity can fully decarbonise the European electricity supply, but large land requirements may cause land-use conflicts. Using a dynamic model that captures renewable fluctuations, I explore the relationship between land requirements and cost of different supply-side options. Cost-minimal fully renewable electricity requires some 97,000\ km^2^ (2% of total) land for solar and wind power installations, roughly the size of Portugal, and includes large shares of onshore wind. Replacing onshore wind with offshore wind, utility-scale PV, or rooftop PV reduces land requirements drastically with only small cost penalties. Moving wind power offshore is most cost-effective and reduces land requirements by 50% for a cost penalty of only 5%. Wind power can alternatively be replaced by photovoltaics, leading to a cost penalty of 10% for the same effect. My research shows that fully renewable electricity supply can be designed with very different physical appearances and impacts on landscapes and the population, but at similar cost.
highlights:
    - Cost-minimal renewable electricity in Europe requires expected 97,000\ km^2^ (2% of total) land for solar and wind.
    - Land requirements can be limited to 48,000\ km^2^ (1%) with an expected cost penalty of 5%.
    - Despite uncertainty, cost penalties to reach 1% or even 0.5% of total land are likely below 20%.
    - Offshore wind reduces land requirements most cost-effectively.
