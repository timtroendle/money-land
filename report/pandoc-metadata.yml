    Renewable electricity allows to fully decarbonise the European electricity supply, but its large land requirements can cause conflicts as it competes with other land uses and is sometimes seen as an interference in landscape. Using a dynamic model that captures renewable fluctuations, I explore cost-effective ways to reduce land requirements through supply technologies with no or low land requirements: offshore wind, solar photovoltaics on roofs and solar photovoltaics on open fields. Cost-minimal renewable electricity requires some 97,000\ km² (2% of total land) of land for solar and wind installations, roughly the size of Portugal. All three technologies allow to reduce cost-minimal land requirements drastically, with offshore wind being the most cost-effective option: a reduction of 50% leads to an expected cost penalty of only 5%. My research shows that fully renewable electricity supply can be designed with very different physical appearances and impacts on landscapes and the population, but at similar cost.
highlights:
    - Cost-minimal renewable electricity in Europe requires expected 97,000\ km^2^ (2% of total) land for solar and wind.
    - Land requirements can be limited to 49,000\ km^2^ (1%) with an expected cost penalty of 5%.
    - Despite uncertainty, cost penalties to reach 1% or even 0.5% of total land are likely below 20%.
    - Offshore wind reduces land requirements most cost-effectively.
