    Renewable electricity allows to fully decarbonise the European electricity supply, but its large land requirements can cause land use conflicts. Using a dynamic model that captures renewable fluctuations, I explore cost-effective ways to reduce land requirements through supply technologies with no or low land requirements: offshore wind, solar photovoltaics on roofs and on fields. Cost-minimal renewable electricity requires some 97,000\ km² (2% of total) land for solar and wind installations, roughly the size of Portugal. All three technologies allow to reduce land requirements drastically, with cost penalties that must not be large: the most cost-effective option leads to a cost penalty of only 5% for a reduction of 50% by moving wind power offshore.  Wind power can alternatively be replaced by photovoltaics, leading to a cost penalty of 10% for the same effect. My research shows that fully renewable electricity supply can be designed with very different physical appearances and impacts on landscapes and the population, but at similar cost.
highlights:
    - Cost-minimal renewable electricity in Europe requires expected 97,000\ km^2^ (2% of total) land for solar and wind.
    - Land requirements can be limited to 48,000\ km^2^ (1%) with an expected cost penalty of 5%.
    - Despite uncertainty, cost penalties to reach 1% or even 0.5% of total land are likely below 20%.
    - Offshore wind reduces land requirements most cost-effectively.
