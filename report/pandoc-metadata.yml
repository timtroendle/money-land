    Renewable electricity allows to fully decarbonise the European electricity supply. Compared to fossil-fuel or nuclear based electricity generation, renewable electricity requires significantly more land, however. Its land impact can cause conflicts, as it competes with other land uses, ::disturbs ecosystems,:: and it can be seen as an interference in landscape. Using a dynamic model that captures renewable fluctuations, I explore cost-effective ways to reduce land use compared to a cost-minimal case through supply technologies with no or low land use: offshore wind, solar photovoltaics on roofs and solar photovoltaics on open fields. Cost-minimal renewable electricity requires 93,000 km²  (1.9%) of land for solar and wind installations, roughly the size of Portugal. The three technologies provide the potential to reduce land use by 50% and more, with offshore wind being the most cost-effective technology: halving land use using offshore wind only requires a cost penalty of ::8 %::. To save the same amount of land, utility-scale and roof mounted photovoltaics increase expected cost by ::12 and 22 %::. My research shows that renewable electricity supply in Europe is possible and economically viable with largely different land use patterns.
highlights:
    - Cost-minimal renewable electricity in Europe requires expected 93,000 km^2^ (1.9%) onshore land.
    - Land use can be reduced significantly with only small cost penalities.
    - Offshore wind requires a cost pentalty of 8% to halve onshore land use (0.41 EUR / m^2^ / yr).
    - Utility-scale PV requires a cost penalty of 12% to halve land use (0.58 EUR / m^2^ / yr).
    - Rooftop PV requires the highest cost penalty of 22% to halve land use (1 EUR / m^2^ / yr).
