    Trade-off between land use and cost of renewable electricity in Europe.
highlights:
    - Cost-minimal renewable electricity in Europe requires 120,000 km^2^ onshore land (2.5%).
    - Land use can be reduced significantly with only small cost penalities.
    - Offshore wind allows to reduce onshore land use for 0.2 EUR / m^2^ / yr.
    - Utility-scale PV allows to reduce land use for 0.7 EUR / m^2^ / yr.
    - Rooftop PV has highest cost of land use decreases of up to 4.6 EUR / m^2^ / yr.
